<p><a href="http://www.companeo.com">Companeo</a> brings service suppliers and their SMB potential clients together, through online quotes. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=54849762">Arnaud Val√©ry</a>, Product Director, explains how Botify Log Analyzer was instrumental in the organic traffic growth the website experienced over the past few months.</p>
<p><strong>Botify: When did you start using Botify Log Analyzer?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Arnaud Valery:</strong> A little over one year ago. I discovered Botify in June 2013, during Search Marketing Expo (SMX). I was about to take over the SEO department&#8217;s management at Companeo, a website with a dozen years of existence.  Understanding where we were from handover meetings was not easy, especially with such history. I needed a detailed assessment of the situation. That is exactly what Botify&#8217;s value proposition was about, with answers to questions such as: how big is my website? which pages does Google know? I was fully convinced when I saw the reconciliation circles showing these two pieces of information *[see below]*, and the analytical logic behind Botify Log Analyzer dashboards and reports. This tool saves considerable time and provides visibility over what&#8217;s really going on &#8211; things we wouldn&#8217;t know about otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>What was the context, at Companeo?</strong></p>
<p>In July 2013, we were about to go through a website migration that had been prepared by my predecessor. This migration aimed at moving from a form-based quote website, to a content-oriented website, with guides and news articles for instance. We performed the first website crawl then, right after the migration. As a first step, Botify Log Analyzer mainly helped identify what needed to be &#8220;cleaned&#8221; on the website. That was a requirement, considering how the number of pages had kept growing over time, to reach several hundred thousand pages.<br />
The graph shows, in a nutshell, the results we achieved: the website perimeter was reduced, resulting in higher quality, according to today&#8217;s criteria; Google crawls the site much more efficiently, now that it is smaller.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20141003_030145_volumes_3.png"></p>
<p><strong>What did this &#8220;cleaning&#8221; consist of?</strong></p>
<p>First, we removed duplicates from various origins, including tracking parameters for old marketing campaigns, as well as  pseudo-duplicates. We did this in several rounds, to make sure we did not impact existing organic traffic, as a significant part of the traffic was generated by these pages. We also optimized redirections: there were many redirections, as they had been piling up over the years. It took us four months to complete this &#8220;heavy duty cleaning&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>How did that impact Google&#8217;s crawl?</strong></p>
<p>Today, Google only explores the part of the website we decided it should see. Our site has a leaner structure. It is obvious that Google understands it better. Its crawl returns much higher quality signals, from a page content perspective as well as a from an HTTP status code perspective *[see graph below]*.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20140828_093801_crawl-http.png"></p>
<p>Volumes distribution has also  changed, between the website area we focused our efforts on and now hosts the new content, and the historical area. Previously, 90% to  95% of Google&#8217;s crawl targeted the historical area. Today, it represents at most 60% of the crawl, and the rest of the crawl is dedicated to new content. The historical area remains interesting because of its <a href="https://www.botify.com/learn/guides/keywords-head-terms-vs-long-tail" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="9" title="long tail keywords" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long tail</a> traffic potential. Overall, Google&#8217;s crawl is much more balanced.</p>
<p><strong>What did you observe, in terms of visibility?</strong></p>
<p>Our Search Metrics visibility index increased fivefold over the past six months.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20141002_140144_searchmetrics.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>And in terms of organic traffic?</strong></p>
<p>Significant traffic growth year over year, as the following graphs show.<br />
The first graph, below, shows global organic traffic growth.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20140905_091735_visits.png"></p>
<p>This other graph shows SEO traffic by type of page. Visits are now generated by a wider variety of types of pages. This is much healthier.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20140828_121046_visits-by-tag.png"></p>
<p>This other graph, below, complements the information above: it shows <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/active-pages">active pages</a> volumes by type of page, that is to say, the distribution of pages which generate organic visits. We can see that a lower number of pages generate more visits, as we removed pages which did not meet today&#8217;s requirements, and created new pages with strict specifications in terms of content quality. This is very positive for usage statistics.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20140828_121046_active-pages-by-tag.png"></p>
<p>Here is one last graph, which summarizes year-over-year progress, as far as Google&#8217;s view of the website is concerned, and as far as organic visits are concerned *[on the right]*, with page type details:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20140905_093214_crawledP-vs-visits-2013vs2014-updated.png"></p>
<p>Our work&#8217;s result is clearly visible on pre-existing areas (numbered), and on new contents as well.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s next?</strong></p>
<p>Up until May 2014, we mainly worked on technical projects. Now that we can rely on a healthier and smaller structure, with a higher <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/monitor-your-crawl-ratio">crawl rate</a> and a higher <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/active-pages">active pages rate</a>, we are also working on other typical SEO topics, such as semantics &#8211; data on title H1, and other tags issued from the crawl Botify come in very handy &#8211;  and internal linking.</p>
