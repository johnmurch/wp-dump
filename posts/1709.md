<p>A good illustration is worth a thousand word. The Botify Log Analyzer report includes many graphs, each with several display options. Here&#8217;s how to get the best view to analyze the situation, answer specific questions, or prove your point in a presentation.</p>
<p>The report&#8217;s home shows an overview, and you can select the type of indicators you want to see on the right (see open dropdown list below). What we&#8217;d like to draw your attention to are the two other choices, circled in red, that are available throughout the report:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="#perimeter">data perimeter</a> (&#8220;all&#8221; for the full website in the report home)</li>
<li>The <a href="#detail">level of detail shown in the graphs</a> (values minimum %)</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20140909_034441_BLAreport-home.png"></p>
<h2 id="-a-id-perimeter-choose-the-data-perimeter-a-"><a id="perimeter">Choose the data perimeter </a></h2>
<p>The drop-down list on the left allows to select a portion of the website, according to the URL categorization that was defined prior to the analysis.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20140909_081000_BLAreport-cat-header.png"></p>
<p>As the categorization can include several levels of subcategories to meet your analysis requirements, a new drop down list will appear if the selected category has subcategories, as you navigate down the tree structure:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20140909_051756_BLAreport-cat-level1.png"></p>
<p>Categories that have subcategories end with &#8220;/*&#8221;:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20140909_051756_BLAreport-cat-level2.png"></p>
<p>Here the URL categorization has 5 levels:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20140909_054934_BLAreport-cat-level5.png"></p>
<p>Once you have selected the category you would like to look at, you may need to adjust the level of detail shown in the graph, so that the graph&#8217;s message is loud and clear &#8211; very useful to get the perfect graph to illustrate your slides for a meeting, for instance.</p>
<h2 id="-a-id-detail-adjust-the-level-of-detail-shown-in-the-graph-a-"><a id="detail">Adjust the level of detail shown in the graph</a></h2>
<p>All selected page categories are not necessarily shown in the graphs by default: only those representing at least 1% of the volume are displayed initially. Which is good to get a first sense of the situation. For instance, here is an example of pages found by the Botify crawler that are also crawled by Google:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20140909_073312_BLAreport-distri-crawled-1pct.png"></p>
<p>If you would like to see them all, then select &#8220;all values&#8221;:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20140908_150019_BLAreport-values.png"></p>
<p>In this case, the difference between sub-categories is such that we don&#8217;t see some of them in the graph (low figures can be found in the full data table at the bottom of the page &#8211; and if we want a graph, we&#8217;ll need to &#8220;zoom in&#8221; on these categories, by selecting it).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20140909_065105_BLAreport-distri-crawled-all.png"></p>
<p>If we select only categories which represent at least 3% of the volume, the graph becomes:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20140909_071744_BLAreport-distri-crawled-3pct.png"></p>
<p>This functionality is also particularly useful for the &#8220;relative&#8221; view, which uses doughnut charts, as it becomes difficult to distinguish between many colors shown in the legend, as in the example below:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20140909_071210_BLAreport-distri-crawled-all-relative.png"></p>
<p>Of course, when looking at the report online, you can hover your mouse over an area to identify the page category. But what if you want to include the graph in a presentation?</p>
<p>In our example, the graph showing only value above 2% (and the rest as &#8220;others&#8221;) is much easier to read:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20140910_032213_BLAreport-distri-crawled-2pct-relative.png"></p>
<p>This adjustment applies to all indicators that are displayed by page category, that is to say all but page depth (which shows page depth distribution for all selected page categories).</p>
