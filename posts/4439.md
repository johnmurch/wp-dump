<p><em>The marriage between an Innovative e-commerce site and an <a href="https://www.botify.com/platform" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="1" title="enterprise seo platform">enterprise SEO</a> solution led to substantial revenue growth from organic search.</em></p>



<p><br>In Japan, a renowned e-commerce food &amp; beverage retailer has answered the call for innovation. In that market, 65% of customers in Japan like to order their food from both the web and/or an app.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>To drive additional online revenue, the brand decided to empower customers to order their meals online via their website, in addition to their app. Customers can then conveniently pick up the food in the nearest store.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-challenges-objectives">Challenges &amp; Objectives</h2>



<p>Covid-19 has altered consumer behaviour in fundamental ways. Consumers refrained from leaving their homes and instead searched and shopped online, going out primarily for essential in-store buying and pickups. Therefore, the 2020 launch of the company’s online order platform through their website became a critical project for the brand. It was not only positioned as one of the main revenue growth drivers during the pandemic, but it was also designed to greatly enhance the customer experience with the brand.</p>



<p>The brand discovered that 47% of their traffic &#8211; millions of customers every month &#8211; comes to their website from organic search (at zero cost of acquisition of course).&nbsp;</p>



<p><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color"><strong>How can the brand fully capitalize the organic traffic and convert it into additional sales through their online ordering platform?</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>



<p>To make the new online ordering channel generate substantial and sustainable sales revenue as efficiently as possible, there were two main drivers that the brand needed to sort out:</p>



<ul><li>How to drive more quality traffic to the site, and</li><li>How to drive conversions of consumers to order from the menu and product pages</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Botify Helped</h2>



<p>Botify helped the brand to make this critical mission come alive with its enterprise SEO solution.</p>



<p>The brand adopted Botify’s full funnel search methodology and leveraged its <a href="https://www.botify.com/platform/botify-analytics">unified data model</a>, powered by the integration of all of the critical first-party search datasets (crawl, logs, keywords, visits, and revenue data) into a central platform. In doing so, the brand was able to garner insights at every stage of the search process, starting from crawl budget analysis and indexability through to ranking and conversions. Thorough SEO audits gave them a holistic view into the performance of their website, including metrics on content visibility, site pages indexability, key valuable pages and unexpected or unknown technical issues. Furthermore, Botify provided prescriptive insights to help them prioritize their website optimizations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Important milestones were achieved in these areas:</p>



<ul><li>Crawl budget optimization</li><li><a href="https://www.botify.com/learn/basics/what-are-url-parameters" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="4" title="url parameters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parameter</a> and facet control&nbsp;</li><li>Content quality optimization</li><li>Internal link optimization</li><li>Mobile optimization</li></ul>



<p>Additionally, because Botify can integrate, store, and analyze revenue and conversion data alongside other SEO data, the brand was able to easily attribute the impact of organic search on e-commerce sales.&nbsp;</p>
