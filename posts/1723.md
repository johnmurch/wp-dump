<p>And now that the year is over, we wanted to highlight the top Botify innovations that made 2018 extra special!</p>
<h3 id="structured-data-analysis-audit-your-schema-enterprise-scale-for-competitive-search-advantages">Structured Data Analysis: Audit Your Schema, Enterprise-Scale, For Competitive Search Advantages</h3>
<p>Google&#8217;s latest moves on topics such as <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2017/12/rich-results-tester.html">rich results</a>, <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/voice-search-optimization/231319/">voice search</a>, and <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/google-jobs-new-guidelines-stay-compliant-and-visible-with-botify">job postings</a> signal that the era of <a href="https://www.botify.com/learn/guides/structured-data-basics-using-schema-org-to-help-search-engines-understand-your-content" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="3" title="structured data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">structured data</a> is here!</p>
<p>In 2018, Botify began <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/breaking-news-introducing-botify-structured-data-optimizations">collecting and analyzing structured data</a> for all crawled webpages. With this unmatched volume, we&#8217;ve given our customers structured data optimizations on an unprecedented enterprise scale.</p>
<p>Structured data enables you to gain more SERP space and higher CTR through rich results. Generate rich results and beyond with Botify&#8217;s structured data analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discover structured data errors automatically.</li>
<li>Export URLs with structured data issues to identify all pages that can&#8217;t generate rich results.</li>
<li>Crawl competitors&#8217; sites to discover key information about their structured data use and content.</li>
<li>Segment and filter pages using structured data, like any other KPI in the Botify platform.</li>
<li>Combine structured data with 500+ SEO KPIs to drive strategic SEO decisions</li>
</ul>
<p>With Botify, you can use structured data not just to generate rich results, but also to <a href="https://ww2.botify.com/l/229872/2018-08-30/3xl9v">illuminate technical SEO insights</a>. Chart crawl frequency by product ratings to find highly rated pages that need increased visibility. Analyze article author against content size and real ranking to improve content quality.</p>
<p>Make your structured data an asset in more ways than one with Botify!</p>
<h3 id="content-quality-dashboard-analyze-all-of-google-s-multivariate-content-ranking-signals-in-one-place">Content Quality Dashboard: Analyze All of Google&#8217;s Multivariate Content Ranking Signals in One Place</h3>
<p>Ascendant technologies such as AMP, structured data, and mobile devices have all impacted the way Google assesses content quality. At the same time, the mainstays of content quality &#8211; like length, duplication, and template versus non-template &#8211; continue to play fundamental roles.</p>
<p>In 2018, Botify became the only platform that bridges this gap between old and new in the realm of content quality, as recognized by our win at the <a href="https://www.grandprixdusearch.com/">Grand Prix du Search 2018</a> for our AI project about analyzing templated/not templated content.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/analyze-all-of-google's-content-ranking-signals-in-a-single-dashboard-with-Botify">content quality analysis</a> is designed to track and analyze all of Google&#8217;s multivariate content ranking signals, on the largest scale imaginable‚Ä¶in a new single dashboard! Here&#8217;s a rundown of the new dashboard:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Evaluate Your Content Like Google Does:</strong> Botify is the only platform that separates templated material (navigation, footers, sidebar) from the actual content of the page. Botify, like Google, analyzes content uniqueness, or the percentage of the page that&#8217;s unique to each specific page, including content thinness. Like Google, Botify analyzes page similarity, on an enterprise scale.</li>
<li><strong>Prepare for the Mobile-First Index: &#8211; Match the Parity Between Your Mobile &amp; Desktop Content:</strong> Compare mobile vs. desktop content to ensure parity and content quality across all versions of your site. Match AMP pages to their desktop equivalents with interactive charts that map similarity across site segments. For the first time, understand the relationship between mobile page compliance and organic visits.</li>
<li><strong>Target Opportunities &amp; Find Optimizations with Dedicated Structured Data Insights:</strong> Optimize structured data on your website by identifying structured data errors, at scale. Understand how different structured data types are deployed across your website to spot opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Analyze the Classic SEO Components:</strong> Hone in on potentially quick and easy optimizations across facets such as HTML tags. Correct duplicate titles to differentiate content and target key searchers. Add meta descriptions to increase click through rate from the SERP. Ensure canonicals are implemented properly. Understand anchor text distribution across a website.</li>
</ul>
<p>Botify&#8217;s new content quality dashboard comes stacked with everything that makes Botify unique, including segmentation, comparison over time, and enterprise exports.</p>
<h3 id="visits-report-reorient-your-visits-data-for-radical-new-insights">Visits Report: Reorient Your Visits Data for Radical New Insights</h3>
<p>With revolutionary visibility, our new <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/breaking-news-introducing-botifys-new-visits-report">Visits Report</a> is a comprehensive solution that captures the many facets of traffic, delivering AMP and multi-device metrics, visits quality KPIs, the impact of content, and the influence of a diverse set of SEO indicators all on the same axis. Some of the most notable innovations include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Approach the Mobile-First Index with Granular AMP &amp; Multi-Device Insights:</strong> Uncover active (traffic-generating) pages, average session duration, load time, and more, all separated by device. Evaluate metrics by segment. Understand how your AMP pages factor into visits volume overall and by segment. Measure bounce rates of AMP pages and session duration.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor Content Quality to Understand How Your Priorities Are Paying Off:</strong> Visits Report directly ties organic visits to content quality markers, at scale. Understand how content size, content duplication, and page title and h1 tag uniqueness effect visits distribution and your site&#8217;s number of active URLs.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluating the Quality of Your Visits Is Made Easy:</strong> Just how valuable did visitors find your content? Dive into visits quality through bounce rate by device, bounce rate distribution, and session duration. Google also uses these metrics as ranking signals. With Visits Report, you can finally understand how content quality impacts your traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Come Full Circle: Combine Visits &amp; Technical SEO to Optimize the Entire Organic Search Process:</strong> Visits Report takes traffic several steps beyond standard analytics tools by contextualizing organic visits with quality markers. Understand the impact of inlinks on visits. Evaluate internal <a href="https://www.botify.com/learn/basics/pagerank" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="8" title="page rank" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PageRank</a>, page depth, and load time alongside key content and device metrics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Visits Report is the only solution that illuminates how content and technical SEO directly impact visits performance.</p>
<h3 id="javascript-crawl-illuminate-the-hidden-indexable-content-on-your-site">JavaScript Crawl: Illuminate the Hidden Indexable Content on Your Site</h3>
<p>This year, we pushed the limit on the scale that you can crawl and analyze JavaScript content. Our first-in-class JavaScript crawler can now handle larger JS sites, servicing even the most complex and demanding stacks on the web today. Botify empowers users to analyze JavaScript content with a robust set of SEO KPIs, extracting actionable insights that result in tangible ROI.</p>
<p>Botify&#8217;s JavaScript crawl can evaluate text rendered with JavaScript, capture and follow href links rendered with JS, and follow JS redirects. New JavaScript-specific metrics are being added into the platform daily, including key KPIs such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>No. Resources Executed</li>
<li>First Meaningful Paint</li>
<li>Delay to Render the Page</li>
<li>No. of Resources Crawler Failed to Fetch</li>
<li>No. of Resources Allowed</li>
<li>Among others!</li>
</ul>
<p>The Botify crawler also excludes certain JS files, such as web analytics and cache resources, to reduce stress on the crawled website. Botify&#8217;s JavaScript capabilities ultimately improve the comprehensiveness of your site crawls and help you to understand the implications of all your indexable content.</p>
<h3 id="crawl-comparison-instantly-compare-two-crawls-including-reports-kpis-to-map-changes-over-time">Crawl Comparison: Instantly Compare Two Crawls, Including Reports &amp; KPIs, to Map Changes Over Time</h3>
<p>Botify&#8217;s <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/in-one-click-navigate-the-archive-of-your-seo-website-versions-with">new comparison capabilities</a> allow SEOs to instantly compare any Botify KPI with that of a past analysis.</p>
<p>Whether the change was enacted one week ago, one month ago, or one year ago, our comparison feature dynamically renders instant analysis of the changes between any two Botify crawls or KPIs of your choice.</p>
<p>Immediately compare any data point between two Botify analyses, from the biggest top level reports, to the most granular, specific KPIs. Botify&#8217;s crawl comparison is the most detailed &#8211; and only &#8211; solution that can reveal how any facet of a website has changed for the better&#8230; or for the worse.</p>
<p>Our customers have created their own use cases. But some important uses of this new feature at both the URL and site segment level include the ability to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compare mobile vs. desktop site versions to ensure a smooth entry into the mobile-first index.</li>
<li>Pinpoint traffic declines between periods to discover the active pages that show a decreasing number of visits over time.</li>
<li>Identify the number of added or disappeared pages within a section or subsection of a website.</li>
<li>Contrast the HTML code between two versions of the same webpage.</li>
<li>Identify if Google is crawling strategic pages more or less frequently.</li>
<li>Evaluate the effectiveness of optimizations on page speed.</li>
</ul>
<p>And many more!</p>
<p>No more guesswork. Botify&#8217;s new comparison feature eliminates all uncertainty about what impact SEO projects have on your digital assets.</p>
