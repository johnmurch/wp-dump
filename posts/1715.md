<p><strong>New York, New York and Paris, France &#8212; February 26, 2019</strong> &#8212; <a href="https://www.botify.com/">Botify</a>, the new standard in organic search marketing, today announced that it has closed $20 million in Series B funding and is opening its second U.S. headquarters in Seattle, Washington. Botify&#8217;s Series B financing was led by Idinvest Partners, with participation from Ventech, bringing the company&#8217;s total funding to $27 million. The investment will be used to fuel product innovation, customer adoption and success, and global expansion.</p>
<p>&#8220;With today&#8217;s financing and the tremendous support of our investors, we will further cement Botify as the go-to partner for enterprise search professionals,&#8221; stated Adrien Menard, CEO and Co-Founder of Botify. &#8220;Since we founded Botify in 2012 and subsequently made our U.S. debut in 2016 at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/09/botify-is-an-seo-crawler-that-helps-your-website-optimize-for-googlebot/">Techcrunch Disrupt</a>, organic search has gained complexity due to ‚Äòmobile-first&#8217; initiatives and the predominance of Javascript. Botify is in a unique place to solve these complexities with our device-agnostic, technical <a href="https://www.botify.com/platform" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="1" title="enterprise seo platform">SEO platform</a>, which is quickly becoming the new standard interface between search engines and large websites looking to be indexed in organic search results.&#8221;</p>
<p>Botify&#8217;s Seattle headquarters, which opens March 1, will be home to both sales and customer success professionals. This team will extend Botify&#8217;s worldwide footprint, providing enterprises with the data, tools, and diagnostics necessary to create and maintain high quality digital assets for search engines and voice assistants.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that Botify has the right vision for this market.They&#8217;re delivering a great impact for their customers and are poised to take the enterprise search marketing sector to new heights,&#8221; said Benoist Grossmann, Managing Partner, Idinvest Partners. &#8220;We are extremely impressed with the work Botify has done to date and we&#8217;re very excited to continue to support them in this next chapter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thomas Grange, CTO and Co-Founder of Botify continued, &#8220;Search is the DNA of the web, if it doesn&#8217;t work, the web doesn&#8217;t work. With approximately 80,000 queries done every second on search engines, it is critical for companies to optimize the organic search process to be found. In fact, if you&#8217;re searching the web, you&#8217;re likely clicking on results optimized based on insights provided by Botify as we are working with some of the world&#8217;s largest enterprises such as Expedia, Nike, Marriott, and hundreds more.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding comes on the heels of a stellar year in which Botify grew over 200% in the U.S. and delivered many innovations, such as <a href="https://www.botify.com/learn/guides/structured-data-basics-using-schema-org-to-help-search-engines-understand-your-content" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="3" title="structured data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">structured data</a> analysis, javascript crawling, mobile versus desktop parity content analysis; and the release of Botify Keywords.
