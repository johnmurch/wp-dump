<p>The Botify crawler&#8217;s primary objective is to analyze your website as search engines see it &#8211; or as they would, if they could devote unlimited time to your site&#8217;s exploration.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a powerful ally in a number of other situations, as soon as you would like some ‚Äòreal world&#8217; testing: automated redirects, special treatment according to user&#8217;s characteristics, or, simply, a site under construction. You can now customize the Botify crawler&#8217;s user-agent. It will introduce itself to the web server wearing the hat you have chosen for him, instead of that of the Botify robot. This allows any testing scenario.</p>
<p>A custom user-agent will allow to:</p>
<p>1) <a href="#mobile">Crawl  the mobile version of a website which redirects users based on their user-agent</a></p>
<p>2) <a href="#pre_prod">Analyze a website in a pre-production environment, before it goes live</a></p>
<p>3) <a href="#like_ggbot">Be treated as Google, when Googlebot receives a special treatment</a></p>
<p>4) <a href="#params">Transmit parameters to conduct specific tests: performance testing, user-language testing, or any other test</a></p>
<p><a id="mobile"><font color="orange"><b></b></font></a></p>
<h2 id="1-crawl-the-mobile-version-of-a-website">1) Crawl  the mobile version of a website</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="Mobile phone" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20140625_091303_free-phone-sm.png" style="float: right; margin:0px 0px 0px 0px;"></p>
<p>If your website redirects to its mobile version based on user-agent information, you can crawl your site using a mobile user&#8217;s user-agent (that of an iPhone for instance) to check that redirects are triggered as planned. You will also be able to check the proportion of page-to-page redirects versus bulk redirects &#8211; the former are for mobile page to perform well in search engines; the latter should be avoided: this will show in the Botify report, which provides the number of incoming redirects per crawled URL.</p>
<p>You can also crawl a second time using a Googlebot Mobile user-agent, to check that the mobile bot is redirected the same way and hence has the same vision of things as mobile internet users. This is a requirement for mobile pages to rank in search engines.</p>

<h2 id="2-analyze-a-website-in-a-pre-production-environment">2) Analyze a website in a pre-production environment</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="under-construction" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20140625_093921_free-cone-sm.png" style="float: right; margin:0px 0px 0px 0px;"></p>
<p>Being able to analyze a version of your website in a pre-production environment is of great value, not only for search engine optimization, but also for change management:</p>
<ul>
<li>For validation purposes: to check a number of criteria before going live,</li>
<li>For decision support purposes: to measure the impact of changes on the website&#8217;s structure &#8211; or compare two changes.<br />
For instance: impact of navigation (such as a new menu or a new block of links to related content) on website depth and internal linking; proportion of a certain type of content (such as user comments) within the website&#8217;s overall volume.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The website&#8217;s robots.txt file disallows all to all user-agents except Botify, as the Botify crawler will continue to follow rules defined for it, even if it presents itself as another user-agent.</li>
<li>The Botify is started with a custom user-agent that is known only to people participating in the project &#8211; which could be an existing user-agent used internally by the website&#8217;s technical team, that is systematically white-listed.</li>
<li>The website returns an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden) to all user-agents except the one used for the test crawl.</li>
</ul>
<p><a id="like_ggbot"><font color="orange"><b></b></font></a></p>
<h2 id="3-be-treated-as-google-when-googlebot-receives-a-special-treatment">3) Be treated as Google, when Googlebot receives a special treatment</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="robot" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20140625_093025_robot-sm.png" style="float: right; margin:0px 0px 0px 0px;"></p>
<p>When Google&#8217;s bots are not treated the same way as other user-agents, we may want to crawl &#8216;as Googlebot&#8217; to get a result that is in line with what the search engine sees.</p>
<p>This might be the case for different reasons, without implying the site is using cloaking (which would mean that search engines are shown a different content than that shown to users, which, depending on the nature of content differences, might be considered as deceptive and might be sanctioned by Google if considered abusive).</p>
<p>For instance, performance has been optimized by eliminating tasks that are not applicable to search engines (such as creating a user session). In this case, we&#8217;ll want performance analysis results to match Google&#8217;s actual experience of the website.</p>
<p><strong>How:</strong></p>
<p>By using a user-agent build from Googlebot&#8217;s user agent, and adding a character chain that is specific to the website of the project. As a result:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ‚ÄòGooglebot&#8217; part of the user-agent will be detected and will trigger a special treatment as expected</li>
<li>The additional element will allow to easily distinguish the real Googlebot crawl (from Google) from the fake Googlebot crawl (from the Botify analysis) in the server logs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Avoid ‚Äòpolluting&#8217; log files with fake data!</strong></p>
<p>The second point is key: without this additional element, log files analysis could be skewed, as some Googlebot crawls could be taken into account, while they weren&#8217;t actually from Google.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not all. People who manage and analyze log files need to know there are lines with a ‚ÄòGoogle-like&#8217; user-agent that need to be removed before performing any analysis. That&#8217;s precisely why Botify needs to validate any custom user-agent that includes one of the top search engines&#8217; bots names (Googlebot, Bingbot, Yandex, Baidu, Yahoo&#8217;s Slurp).</p>
<p><a id="params"><font color="orange"><b></b></font></a></p>
<h2 id="4-transmit-parameters-to-conduct-specific-tests">4) Transmit parameters to conduct specific tests</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="test tubes" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20140625_091303_test-tubes-sm.png" style="float: right; margin:0px 0px 0px 0px;"></p>
<p>Using a custom user-agent, any test is possible. You can add to the user-agent any element that can be detected by the web server and trigger a special treatment. Parameters could apply to technical or functional elements, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automated authorizations for restricted access content (as if a user was logged in for instance)</li>
<li>Respond with or without using cache functionality</li>
<li>Respond with or without using specific performance optimizations</li>
<li>Language information included in the user-agent, to test redirections of users to the correct local version of the website (which, for users, would normally be done according to the ‚ÄòAccept-language&#8217; field of the HTTP header)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="internet-politeness">Internet politeness</h2>
<p>We&#8217;re talking about manipulating user-agents, which are sorts of business cards on the Internet. But a crawler&#8217;s behavior and speed have nothing to do with what can be expected from an Internet user. That&#8217;s why Internet politeness rules suggest to include a link in the user-agent, so that the owner or manager of a website can contact without delay someone who has control over the crawler. We strongly advise to follow this politeness rule with custom user-agents.</p>
<p>As for crawl speed, the Botify crawler does everything in its power to avoid straining the website it is crawling:  it adjusts its crawl rate not only according to configured speed, but also according to the website&#8217;s response delay, which can indicate strain.</p>
