<p>We&#8217;re thrilled to announce that Botify is the first SaaS <a href="https://www.botify.com/platform" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="1" title="enterprise seo platform">SEO platform</a> to offer a comprehensive 25 million page crawl! Our enterprise customers can now fully analyze up to 25 million pages per domain in a single crawl with Botify.</p>



<p>Botify now offers a completely customizable SaaS subscription for crawling capacities that stretch up to 25 million pages. This is the beginning of a new way to see your enterprise site.</p>



<p>And the best part: this new capacity still includes all the same analytics and features that make our platform the superior technical SEO solution for enterprise websites.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="25-million-reasons-to-think-big">25 Million Reasons to Think Big</h3>



<p>At Botify, we&#8217;re on a mission to give SEOs all the data they need to define their strategies, whatever the size of their websites. We want SEOs to see the full picture, so they can craft impactful optimizations that are backed up by the most comprehensive analyses available.</p>



<p>Does a 25 million page crawl change anything? Yes&#8230;and no.</p>



<p>Yes, it changes everything for our engineering team, because the volume of processed data increased considerably. Botify collects 500+ KPIs per page, and applying this depth to an unprecedented scale of 25 million pages was a challenge. But we were ultimately able to provide the same high standards of efficiency and thoroughness even at this vast scale.</p>



<p>But no, it doesn&#8217;t change anything for our users. While our engineers made changes behind the scenes, our users won&#8217;t notice any differences in terms of the depth and completeness of Botify&#8217;s analysis. Users still have access to all Botify&#8217;s diverse reporting capabilities regardless of crawl size. Even with a 25 million page crawl, users can still manipulate their data the same way they would for a 10,000 page crawl.</p>



<p>So it&#8217;s not just the volume that makes the 25 million page crawl powerful. It&#8217;s the volume combined with the comprehensiveness. Users of the 25 million page crawl will have access to all of the features that make Botify unique, such as:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Segmentation</strong> &#8211; Group URLs into segments and apply SEO analysis to specific portions of your website. With a 25 million page crawl, <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/SEO-organized-new-segment-filters">segmentation allows you to organize your website</a> in the way that works best for your business, so you can analyze trends and set priorities across page types within the mass of data.

Botify gives you power to easily analyze and understand this data:<img decoding="async" src="//images.contentful.com/x3pujrb0lw7o/9BjNOJy7cckAYGSMgo0wK/e495fdeba9e0018e1e90af0bc2b7c5af/6billioninlinks.png" alt="6 billion inlinks"></li><li><strong>Think Globally, Act Locally</strong> &#8211; Our 25 million page crawl allows users to think globally while still retaining the most minute details for each crawled page. <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/historical-html-giving-seos-the-full-picture">Historical HTML</a>, for example, stores the raw HTML source of every crawled page when it was crawled, allowing you to understand each crawled page with greater clarity.</li><li><strong>Export Unlimited Data</strong> &#8211; Those who want to manipulate their crawl data outside of Botify, or share the data with internal teams, can export the data in unlimited quantities with <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/enterprise-advanced-exports-unequalled-data-for-your-deep-dives">Enterprise Advanced Exports</a>.

Crawl at up to 250 pages per second. Adjust speed and other key crawl settings during a crawl, or even hit pause on your crawl. Crawl reports are still generated in just 24 hours.</li></ul>



<p>Crawling at a large scale is useless if you don&#8217;t have the capacity to crunch your data the way you want to. That&#8217;s why our 25 million page crawl isn&#8217;t just about the volume of pages. It&#8217;s also about bringing the incisiveness and thoroughness of our platform to a wider frontier, offering all the analytical capacities that make our solution the premier technical SEO platform.</p>



<p>This is the end of the limitations era. SEOs with large sites can now see the full picture. The 25 million SaaS subscription can be customized with the Botify Sales Team. Don&#8217;t hesitate to share your request with us, even if you want a crawl in excess of 25 million. </p>
