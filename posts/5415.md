<p>Organic search is steadily becoming the preferred channel by marketers looking for profitable<em> and </em>sustainable growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/gartner-survey-reveals-marketing-budgets-have-increased-to-9-5--">Recent data from Gartner</a> points to an expected 45% investment increase in the organic channel, averaging about 9% of a CMO’s total marketing budgets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet such investment alone won’t guarantee results. Organic search can be a complex and constantly-evolving landscape, with recent disruptions in Generative AI presenting fresh challenges to brands who want to be found organically. The right data and technology are critical, but so are the expertise and strategic insight required to act quickly and decisively in response to change and opportunity.&nbsp;</p>
