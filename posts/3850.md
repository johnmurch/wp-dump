<p>Botify’s annual conference, <a href="https://www.botify.com/c2c-events">Crawl2Convert (C2C)</a>, is just two days away (Thursday, October 29th) &#8211; and we can’t wait to share what we have in store for you! Although we (sadly) won’t be gathering in person this year, we thought it was vital to recreate some level of connection that the SEO community is used to; to bring everyone together for enriching content, networking, and of course, some fun &#8211; even if that means not leaving your couch!</p>



<p>The theme of this year’s event is <strong>“Unlocking Hidden Potential: The True Value of Organic Search As a Performance Marketing Channel.”</strong>&nbsp; Why? Well, it’s never been more critical for marketing professionals to understand the impact and return of every single channel and every single dollar; to truly know what’s moving the needle, and driving repeatable revenue and sustainable business growth, especially during volatile, unpredictable times. Organic search is an imperative and strategic channel for the long-term success of any digital business, and plays an important role along the <em>entire </em>customer journey. <strong>And we think it’s time for SEO to get the attention and the investment it deserves!&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Through the half-day virtual summit, Crawl2Convert will explore what’s next for organic search &#8211; specifically its expanding role in customer acquisition and revenue generation &#8211; and highlight the role that you &#8211; today’s SEO experts &#8211; have to play in moving it forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Things are about to change in the world of SEO, and Crawl2Convert will explore the potential (and challenges) that come with these changes.&nbsp; So, register for our event below!&nbsp; We’re accommodating global time zones, so choose what’s most appropriate for you!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-networking"><strong>The Networking</strong></h2>



<p>One of the most beneficial aspects of any event is the networking; the opportunity to escape your normal routine for some organic and fruitful conversations with your peers, face-time with your partners, and accidental run-ins with your SEO friends whom you haven’t seen in months. Although we won’t be commiserating about subpar conference food or jet lag, we have created a number of opportunities for you to connect with your SEO and marketing peers around the world &#8211; and of course, with Botify!&nbsp; If our speaker line-up didn’t give it away, we have some pretty fantastic people joining us, so don’t miss out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through our event platform, you can pop into themed networking rooms, set up 1:1 meetings, strike up an impromptu text or video chat, and virtually mingle with attendees who share similar interests.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pro tip: enable the networking feature within your profile and note your areas of interest.&nbsp; </strong>That way, we’ll recommend other attendees with whom you should connect. If you’re logged in, <a href="https://crawl2convert.botify.com/us-2020/me/networking">click here.&nbsp;</a></p>
