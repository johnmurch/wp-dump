<p>Imagine you&#8217;re a clothing retailer. You&#8217;ve done your keyword research and optimized your product and category pages, but can&#8217;t seem to keep up with the consumer&#8217;s changing interests. One day the trend is &#8220;denim jackets&#8221; while the next day consumers are searching for &#8220;trucker jackets&#8221; — but your data doesn&#8217;t show these trends until far after they&#8217;ve passed.</p>
<p>Sound familiar? If so, you&#8217;re not alone.</p>
<p>Many brands are struggling to keep up with the constant changes in search demand — <a href="https://offers.adobe.com/en/na/marketing/landings/_46316_real_time_marketing_insights_study.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">60%</a>, to be exact. This can happen with <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/publisher-seo">publishers</a> and the changing news cycle, pop culture trends that influence travel, and even changes in the weather have the ability to change search demand on a dime.</p>
<p>How can brands be there every time their audience is searching? And how can they capitalize on search trends as they&#8217;re happening?</p>
<p>Real-time SEO data may provide a solution.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-real-time-seo-data-">What is real-time SEO data?</h2>
<p>Real-time SEO data is information about the way your audience is searching, as it happens. Was there an uptick in searches for &#8220;red boots&#8221; yesterday? A recent surge in people searching for &#8220;Copenhagen hotels&#8221; from Canada? Real-time SEO data holds the answer.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re relying on traditional methods of keyword research, you might miss these opportunities. There are two main reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional keyword research typically doesn&#8217;t happen on a recurring basis. Keyword research tends to happen once at the time of writing and then is rarely, if ever, updated after that.</li>
<li>Traditional keyword research methods rely on SERP scraping or third-party data, such as clickstream data, that may not surface keywords until their demand is already on the decline.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-is-real-time-data-important-">Why is real-time data important?</h2>
<p>Real-time searcher data might sound nice, but what are the implications? Is this really something you need to worry about?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s let the data speak for itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>87% of consumers expect to find exactly what they&#8217;re searching for, tailored to them [<a href="https://brpconsulting.com/download/2019-special-report-real-time-retail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BRP</a>]</li>
<li>76% of people who conduct a local search on their smartphones visit a business within 24 hours, and 28% make a purchase [<a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/micro-moments/purchase-decision-mobile-growth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google</a>]</li>
<li>One retailer reported a 600% spike in sales of a product following a demand spike they were prepared for [<a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23974327/orders-lebron-james-lakers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN</a>]</li>
<li>77% of your fellow marketers say that real-time personalization is crucial and something they&#8217;re focusing on [<a href="https://offers.adobe.com/en/na/marketing/landings/_46316_real_time_marketing_insights_study.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe</a>]</li>
</ul>
<p>The people have spoken and marketers have begun to take notice. Are you prepared?</p>
<h2 id="where-can-i-get-real-time-seo-data-">Where can I get real-time SEO data?</h2>
<p>Google provides real-time searcher data via its API, allowing us to see the real words (<a title="How to Check What Keywords your Site is Ranking for the Botify Way" href="https://www.botify.com/blog/how-to-check-what-keywords-your-site-is-ranking-for-the-botify-way">not scraped</a>) people are using, where they&#8217;re searching from, and what devices they&#8217;re using to search.</p>
<p>Botify uses this API to pull in this SEO data daily. This enables us to report on things like trending keywords — which of your keywords are on the uptrend, and which are trending down.</p>
<p>This data is critical for marketers who want to customize and adapt their content to match consumer demand in real time.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-your-organization-use-real-time-seo-data-">How can your organization use real-time SEO data?</h2>
<p>Having real-time SEO data that you can use to customize your brand&#8217;s message to keep pace with changing demand sounds great, but what does this look like in practice?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at a few examples of what this could look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>A travel website notices an uptick in searches for &#8220;NYC hotels,&#8221; from Denmark. They could use that information to make sure their NYC hotels page has proper internationalization, translating into Danish and displaying prices using the Danish Kroner.</li>
<li>A fashion retailer notices their women&#8217;s jackets page is getting a spike in impressions for &#8220;sherpa jacket&#8221; but not a lot of clicks. They could create a unique page just for sherpa jackets in hopes of capturing more clicks, and even opt for paid advertising to get instant exposure in the meantime.</li>
<li>A tech publisher notices an uptick in mobile searches for &#8220;machine learning.&#8221; They could use this information to inform their editorial strategy, writing more content on machine learning and making sure their AMP URLs are working properly.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, real-time SEO data has benefits that extend far beyond SEO. This data gives us a window into real customer behavior, which has an unlimited number of use cases. Use it to inform your paid search team, your user experience team, your product teams, and more.</p>
<p>For brands that want to be always on and always relevant no matter what their audience is searching, this is a necessity.
