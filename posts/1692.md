<p>Gain actionable insights into every factor &#8211; big and small &#8211; that impacts content performance with Botify! Botify enables you to review content quality just like Google does, across millions of pages at a time.</p>
<p>Ascendant technologies such as AMP, <a href="https://www.botify.com/learn/guides/structured-data-basics-using-schema-org-to-help-search-engines-understand-your-content" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="3" title="structured data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">structured data</a>, and mobile devices have all impacted the way Google assesses content quality. At the same time, the mainstays of content quality &#8211; like length, duplication, and template versus non-template &#8211; continue to play fundamental roles.</p>
<p>Botify is the only platform that bridges this gap. Our content quality analysis is designed to track and analyze all of Google&#8217;s multivariate content ranking signals, on the largest scale imaginable‚Ä¶ in a new single dashboard!</p>

<h3 id="evaluate-your-content-like-google-does">Evaluate Your Content Like Google Does</h3>
<p><a name="content"></a></p>
<p>Botify&#8217;s content quality capabilities allow users, in an unprecedented fashion, to analyze content just like Google does.</p>
<p><strong>Content vs. Template &#8211;</strong> Botify is the only platform that separates templated material (navigation, footers, sidebar) from the actual content of the page. This is a key analytical differentiator that must be analyzed in order to truly adopt Google&#8217;s methodology.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="//images.ctfassets.net/x3pujrb0lw7o/1OettRFYIck4Wc6KcWCcqq/98205eb48fa759cf7b256b127104ea15/content-quality-1.png" alt="content-quality-1" /></p>
<p><strong>Content Uniqueness &#8211;</strong> The word count is then determined from the non-templated content. Botify, like Google, analyzes content uniqueness, or the percentage of the page that&#8217;s unique to each specific page. Botify accounts for Google&#8217;s content uniqueness with analysis based on n-gram percentiles.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="//images.ctfassets.net/x3pujrb0lw7o/4qVVjn19NYcWEIyCggE246/1aad2fd39e45243a307034fad02ddac0/content-quality-11.png" alt="content-quality-11" /></p>
<p><strong>Page Similarity &#8211;</strong> Like Google, Botify analyzes page similarity, on an enterprise scale. This identifies all the pages whose non-templated content is similar and analyzes the level of similarity. This helps identify pages or groups of pages that might end up devaluing each other due to duplication.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="//images.ctfassets.net/x3pujrb0lw7o/5vkKKlwIj66MccKysCYK4c/3fbc4526e5847e3298a0317ae7193639/content-quality-3.png" alt="content-quality-3" /></p>
<p>Botify monitors hundreds of content KPIs, touching on topics as diverse as AMP and structured data. But Botify is the only platform whose content quality methodology enables our customers to analyze their content just like Google does, no matter the SEO scenario. And this form of analysis comprises the foundation of our newest dashboard.</p>
<h3 id="match-the-parity-between-your-amp-desktop-content">Match the Parity Between Your AMP &amp; Desktop Content</h3>
<p><a name="amp"></a></p>
<p>Content quality analysis of mobile pages brings its own set of requirements, and Botify is uniquely equipped to verify and optimize these deployments on the largest possible scale.</p>
<p><strong>Content Parity &#8211;</strong> Google has announced that AMP pages must share content parity with their desktop equivalents, or face potential exclusion from AMP-specific search features. Match AMP pages to their desktop equivalents with interactive charts that map similarity across site segments.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="//images.ctfassets.net/x3pujrb0lw7o/61eeiP5VbquMECM6qmUOAo/e354670d0c3c88090639b4fef9b0e33b/image8.png" alt="image8" /></p>
<p>For the first time, understand the relationship between indexable mobile pags and organic visits. Chart active AMP pages versus active desktop pages to measure the disparity between visits.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="//images.ctfassets.net/x3pujrb0lw7o/1gRTxa1iacKMEG8qAUgaS6/6df7889f225cc1384f956cf4c581ea26/content-quality-5.png" alt="content-quality-5" /></p>
<h3 id="target-opportunities-find-optimizations-with-dedicated-structured-data-insights">Target Opportunities &amp; Find Optimizations with Dedicated Structured Data Insights</h3>
<p><a name="SD"></a></p>
<p>Structured data is an important content quality marker because the information within schema can have an affect on how search engines understand and judge the page.</p>
<p>Botify combines the most insightful contextualized charts and reports for structured data into one dashboard.</p>
<p><strong>Structured Data Distribution &#8211;</strong> Understand how structured data is distributed across your website to help determine areas for improvement, and make decisions around what structured data types to build upon or remove.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="//images.ctfassets.net/x3pujrb0lw7o/2xjgksgMf2aU8umAcksGOQ/c0878050c7954bb78be82b39e48dc572/Screen_Shot_2018-04-19_at_4.54.38_PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2018-04-19 at 4.54.38 PM" /></p>
<p><strong>Errors in Your Structured Data &#8211;</strong> Optimize structured data on your website by identifying structured data errors, at scale, and on specific segments of a site to identify high-value opportunities and costly mistakes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="//images.ctfassets.net/x3pujrb0lw7o/3ZoXJdTYHKW4qIkSUwkkgg/2fd900a22623676d0051b53f2397d2d4/Screen_Shot_2018-04-19_at_4.48.44_PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2018-04-19 at 4.48.44 PM" /></p>
<p><strong>Structured Data Types &#8211;</strong> Understand how different structured data <em>types</em> are deployed across your website to spot opportunities to add structured data to key segments or introduce new types.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="//images.ctfassets.net/x3pujrb0lw7o/bCpKWHDIHemKqOSuOUswy/edb377915e64c8782cd99d84d11cd488/image2.png" alt="image2" /></p>
<p>Fully understand structured data as a component of content quality, and generate optimizations that make big impacts on the performance of your content in search!</p>
<h3 id="analyze-the-classics-optimize-html-tags-canonicals-and-anchor-text-sitewide">Analyze the Classics: Optimize HTML Tags, Canonicals, and Anchor Text Sitewide</h3>
<p><a name="classics"></a></p>
<p>Of course, Botify&#8217;s content dashboard enables you to optimize the classic content quality markers too, such as HTML tags, canonicals, anchor text, and more.</p>
<p><strong>HTML Tags for Indexable URLs &#8211;</strong> Hone in on potentially quick and easy optimizations across facets such as HTML tags. Correct duplicate titles to differentiate content and target key searchers. Add meta descriptions to increase click through from the SERP.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="//images.ctfassets.net/x3pujrb0lw7o/377ADlTnhCIyWyoEQKEiiu/9234cb5eae1830ba47247ef1925b6991/Screen_Shot_2018-04-19_at_5.37.27_PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2018-04-19 at 5.37.27 PM" /></p>
<p><strong>Canonical Optimization &#8211;</strong> Ensure canonicals are implemented properly. Google will ignore canonicals that are sending confusing signals or not complying. Identify where there are disparities in the distributions of your canoncials, and understand exactly why this happening.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="//images.ctfassets.net/x3pujrb0lw7o/7LvmVSYRY4Wk8oSUSAm42S/faa1cf1ab183b2eeca64d808a4e48f06/content-quality-10.png" alt="content-quality-10" /></p>
<p><strong>Diversify anchor text &#8211;</strong> Understand anchor text distribution across a website. Gain greater insight into internal linking by discovering pages not just with few links, but also with little diversity of anchor text.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="//images.ctfassets.net/x3pujrb0lw7o/12WIWCEP26qK4A2g8wg0S0/3ce7931c1dd0996c24b01ab40cdc7ce5/image2.png" alt="image2" /></p>
<p>Botify&#8217;s new content dashboard combines all the fundamental, big picture analytical capacities of the platform with the nuts-and-bolts optimizations enabled by these classic optimizations.</p>
<h3 id="create-and-evaluate-high-performing-content-like-google-in-a-single-platform">Create and Evaluate High-Performing Content Like Google, In a Single Platform</h3>
<p><a name="platform"></a></p>
