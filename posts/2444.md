<p>Watch out for sneaky 404s!</p>



<p>Removing 404 &#8220;Not Found&#8221; pages linked on a website is a basic, necessary and recurrent SEO task. Most of these errors are quite straightforward to identify and correct, by listing pages that contain a link to a 404 (many SEO tools allow to do so), and replacing or removing the link. But this may not be enough, as some 404s are sneakier than others: those linked on the website through redirections will remain. These dead ends can be identified with Botify Analytics.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://d121xa69ioyktv.cloudfront.net/storyteller/postimage/20141113_045740_schema-301-to-404.PNG" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="identifying-redirects-to-404s">Identifying Redirects to 404s</h2>



<p>Botify Analytics allows you to identify redirects to 404s easily, using the URL Explorer.</p>



<p>In the report, HTTP codes tab, click on the client errors block:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://d121xa69ioyktv.cloudfront.net/storyteller/postimage/20141113_020909_http-tab-4XX.PNG" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>This displays a sample list of 404 (Not Found) and other client errors (such as 410 &#8211; Gone, 401 &#8211; Unauthorized, 403 &#8211; Forbidden), along with pages that link to them (their referrers).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://d121xa69ioyktv.cloudfront.net/storyteller/postimage/20141127_035716_http-list-4XX.PNG"><img decoding="async" src="https://d121xa69ioyktv.cloudfront.net/storyteller/postimage/20141127_035716_http-list-4XX.PNG" alt="404s and their referers with Botify Analytics"/></a></figure>



<p>Click on &#8220;Explore al URLs&#8221; to see the full list and explore results.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s select only URLs which are the target of a redirection (add a filter to indicate that the &#8220;redirected from&#8221; flag must exist), and display redirections source URLs (start typing &#8220;redirected from&#8221; in the fields to display and select from the drop-down list &#8211; and remove some of the preselected display fields to get a leaner results table).</p>



<p>If there are different types of client errors, it&#8217;s also a good idea to filter on &#8220;HTTP 404&#8221;, then reiterate with other error types, as they will most probably have different causes.</p>



<p>Click on &#8220;Apply&#8221;.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://d121xa69ioyktv.cloudfront.net/storyteller/postimage/20141127_040707_URL-E-404-from-redir.PNG"><img decoding="async" src="https://d121xa69ioyktv.cloudfront.net/storyteller/postimage/20141127_040707_URL-E-404-from-redir.PNG" alt="Detecting redirects to 404s with Botify Analytics"/></a></figure>



<p>In this example, we can see that some 404s are only found through redirects: they don&#8217;t have any internal incoming links.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="redirect-chains">Redirect Chains</h2>



<p>In some cases, it can make sense to also check if there are redirect chains to 404s. This typically happens when:</p>



<ul><li>The server makes several unsuccessful attempts at correcting the URL (add or remove trailing slash, change subdomain….) before ending up with a 404</li><li>There are old redirected links on a website that migrated to HTTPS, and HTTP to HTTPS redirects are added to the mix</li></ul>



<p>We&#8217;ll need to first identify all redirect chains, and then match the results to the 404s above.</p>



<p>Going back to our example, if we change the selected HTTP status codes to 3XX, we&#8217;ll get all redirect chains (URLs that return a redirection, and are themselves the target of a redirection). Let&#8217;s also add &#8220;redirects to&#8221; to the fields to display and click on &#8220;Apply&#8221;.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://d121xa69ioyktv.cloudfront.net/storyteller/postimage/20141127_041929_redir-chain-with-res.PNG"><img decoding="async" src="https://d121xa69ioyktv.cloudfront.net/storyteller/postimage/20141127_041929_redir-chain-with-res.PNG" alt="Detecting redirect chains with Botify Analytics"/></a></figure>



<p>As all information in the URL Explorer is URL centric (related to the URL in the first column), the first line in this example means:<br>[URL from &#8220;redirected from&#8221; column] &#8212; 302 redirect &#8211;&gt; [URL from &#8220;URL&#8221; column] &#8212; 301 redirect &#8211;&gt; [URL from &#8220;redirects to&#8221; column].</p>



<p>These results cover all redirect chains, whatever the HTTP status code of the redirection target (&#8220;redirects to&#8221; column).</p>



<p>If, as in our example, there are many redirect chains, we can narrow the results down by adding filters to :</p>



<ul><li>Select only one type of redirect (301 vs 302)</li><li>Exclude obvious types we know return HTTP 200 (click on any URL from the &#8220;redirect to&#8221; column to find out from the URL&#8217;s detailed information)</li></ul>



<p>In our example, it makes sense to:</p>



<ul><li>Select 301 only (it appears that most 302 are related to user login pages)</li><li>Exclude URLs related to RSS feeds, by filtering out URLs containing &#8220;/rss/&#8221; (a quick check shows that redirection targets returns HTPP 200)</li></ul>



<p>If there are few results, looking at these results and the 404s from redirects will be enough to understand the situation. If there are quite a few results, then we&#8217;ll have to export redirect chains, export 404s from redirects and consolidate data with spreadsheet software to get redirect chains ending with 404s.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="wondering-about-longer-redirection-chains-">Wondering About Longer Redirection Chains?</h2>



<p>What if the redirect chain is longer than 2 redirects? This is more unlikely, but it can happen. We will also be able to detect that it&#8217;s the case as longer redirect chains will appear split into lines.<br>For instance, A → B → C→ D will appear as:</p>



<ul><li>B is redirected from A and redirects to C</li><li>C is redirected from B and redirects to D</li></ul>



<p>So to check for these, all we need is an additional consolidation step: build full redirect chains first, then consolidate with 404s from redirects.</p>
