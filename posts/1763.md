<p>Building on <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/export-millions-of-links-botify-advanced-data-exports">advanced exports</a>, enterprise advanced exports offers the same metrics with unlimited export capability. Botify customers can use enterprise advanced exports for all the exports in our Data Exports section, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>All External Links</li>
<li>All Internal Links</li>
<li>Links to non-indexable URLs</li>
<li>Redirection Links</li>
<li>Broken Links</li>
<li>All URLs Detail</li>
<li>Non-indexable URLs Details</li>
<li><a href="https://www.botify.com/learn/basics/canonical-tags" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="6" title="canonical tags" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canonical Tags</a></li>
<li>Uncrawled URLs from reaching crawl limit</li>
<li>Uncrawled URLs because out of scope</li>
</ul>
<p>Advanced exports can each populate 100 million links and data points per downloadable CSV file. But for the biggest websites, even this gigantic scale can mean an incomplete data set. Enterprise advanced exports eliminates this ceiling, giving large businesses the freedom to manipulate key SEO data on an enterprise scale.</p>
<h3 id="full-reports-for-enterprise-level-datasets">Full Reports for Enterprise-Level Datasets</h3>
<p>Enterprise advanced exports give even our largest customers access to complete data for further manipulation. Botify customers can use their data in third party platforms to generate more complex SEO visualizations and statistical insights. Enterprise advanced exports also allows customers to keep comprehensive off-site records of key crawl information.</p>
<p>Confidence in complete data means SEOs of even the largest sites can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Find broken links</strong> &#8211; see how broken links are affecting a website with redirects and errors without link limitations.</li>
<li><strong>Trace internal links/external links</strong> &#8211; get the full picture of a website&#8217;s linking structure with a complete list of all associated internal and external links.</li>
<li><strong>Discover uncrawled pages</strong> &#8211; download a comprehensive list of all of a website&#8217;s uncrawled URLs due to crawl limits or scope problems.</li>
