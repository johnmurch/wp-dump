<p>Happy new year, SEOs!</p>
<p>2017 was a <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/top-10-botify-releases-of-2017">great year for new Botify features</a>. But 2018 is going to be even more exciting as we travel to brave new SEO frontiers. We wanted to start the new year out with a bang on the features front. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re releasing Botify&#8217;s <a href="https://www.botify.com/learn/guides/structured-data-basics-using-schema-org-to-help-search-engines-understand-your-content" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="3" title="structured data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">structured data</a> optimizations just a few days into 2018.</p>
<p>As companies search for more ways to stand out in the SERPs, Google suggests increased prioritization of rich data (i.e. structured data). In the last weeks of 2017, Google released a <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2017/12/rich-results-tester.html">Rich Results Testing Tool</a> to help webmasters test rich results on their site.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s Rich Results Testing Tool is a great initiative, and one that all SEOs should get behind. But for enterprise SEOs that are responsible for hundreds of thousands, if not millions of pages, reviewing structured data at scale is a daunting task. But today, Botify is answering the calls of our customers by becoming the first platform to analyze structured data at an enterprise scale.</p>
<p>Now you can control and optimize rich results on the largest scale!<br />
<img decoding="async" alt="rich results - components - size 1" src="//images.contentful.com/x3pujrb0lw7o/5UK3w68CROSsYwmCikYweI/315fb1e25b726c62beae45a63f5d0ba7/rich_results_-_components_-_size_1.png"></p>
<h3 id="2018-the-year-of-structured-data-rich-results">2018: The Year of Structured Data &amp; Rich Results</h3>
<p>Structured data enables your web pages to communicate better with search engines by telling them exactly what content is on the page. For instance, if you&#8217;re selling this season&#8217;s hottest new boots, you can use structured data to tell the search engine what they are (product), if you have a killer deal (offer), and how much customers are already loving them (rating).</p>
<p>Structured data makes it easier for Google to understand, process, and present page information to searchers. In turn, Google enables rich results on SERPs for pages that properly implement rich data. Rich results are search results that go beyond the standard blue link. This allows for prominent displays of ratings, product details, corporate contacts, reviews, job postings, and more.</p>
<p>Those rich results can lead to more SERP space and higher CTR. The increased visibility can, in turn, entice searchers to click through to your website, business, or service. When used correctly, structured data is essentially a competitive edge over other businesses on the SERPs.</p>
<p>For instance, which would you rather be: the restaurant with a five star rating, or the one with no rating at all? Now imagine that on an enterprise scale. 500, 5,000, 25,000 restaurants with a five star rating. That can add up.<br />

<h3 id="go-big-or-go-home-botify-is-first-seo-platform-to-analyze-structured-data-at-scale">Go Big or Go Home: Botify is first SEO platform to analyze structured data at scale</h3>

<p>Botify even allows you to break down subcategories within the structured data types. For job postings, extract the job title, industry, education requirements, organization, salary, and more.</p>
<p>For restaurants, extract the phone number, price range, name, and category. Understand, for each page, if and how your structured data schema is fulfilling all the subcategories that Google will consider and utilize for rich results.<br />
