<p><strong>Botify Keywords Gives Search Marketers Power over Search Queries</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Search Intent</strong>: With Botify Keywords, you can see the exhaustive list of keywords visitors are actually using to search for your site. With this visibility, you can optimize content to match the way customers are searching for you.</li>
<li><strong>Trend Detection</strong>: Our advanced ranking solution enables you to detect trends as they are happening. Understand when people start searching for major events. Get ready for Black Friday, Christmas or summer sales. Know immediately when a new trend emerges and capture growing demand.</li>
<li><strong>User Behavior</strong>: Botify Keywords integrates Google CTR with your rankings and technical SEO KPIs. With SERP data, you can see when people don&#8217;t click on your results and what to do about it. Is it a matter of meta tag optimization? URLs? Brand relevance? Understanding user behavior on result pages mean you can prioritize the most impactful SEO projects.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Botify Keywords Shows You How Technical SEO Elements are Affecting Rankings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SEO Indexable</strong>: Are your rankings affected by indexation issues? Too many not indexable pages, broken links, or bad management of canonicals can mean high quality content is not able to be indexed and, as a result, unable to be ranked.</li>
<li><strong>Crawl Budget</strong>: Is my ranking affected by a low crawl ratio, low frequency of crawl or search engine crawl focused on low quality pages? Botify Keywords will uncover how your rankings are impacted by poorly optimized search engine crawl.</li>
<li><strong>Content Quality</strong>: Are there duplication, content size, or content staleness issues that can impact your rankings? Botify offers unique content metrics that evaluate the quality of content for every page on your site.</li>
<li><strong>Internal Linking</strong>: Easily compare how high-ranked pages are linked on your website versus low-ranked pages. Is it a matter of depth, internal linking or internal <a href="https://www.botify.com/learn/basics/pagerank" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="8" title="page rank" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PageRank</a>? Be sure that your strategic content benefits from an optimized internal linking structure to improve rankings.</li>
