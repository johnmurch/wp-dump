<p>Let&#8217;s face it, this scoreboard is purely fictional. Actually, Google Webmaster Tools and Botify are on the same team. And they complement each other very well.</p>
<p>Googe Webmaster Tools alerts and provides pointers. Botify empowers your investigation.</p>
<p>Botify&#8217;s Logs Analyzer helps locate issues and evaluate problem severity: it provides complete data where Google Webmaster Tools provides samples.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at GWT&#8217;s most common automated errors (we&#8217;ll leave aside manual sanctions, alert messages about ‚Äòunnatural&#8217; external linking, malware detection on specific pages etc.).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="Google" crawl="crawl" error="error" menu="menu" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20140617_044051_GWT-menu-crawl-errors-sm.png" style="float: right; margin:0px 0px 0px 30px;" tool="Tool" webmaster="Webmaster"></p>
<p>Google Webmaster Tools sends alert messages when crawl error rates rise. These error rates are available in the Crawl / Crawl errors section, which is divided into Site errors and URL errors.</p>
<p>Main URL errors alerts:</p>
<p>1) <a href="#not_found">Increase in not found errors</a><br />
2) <a href="#soft404">Increase in soft 404 errors</a><br />
3) <a href="#forbidden">Increase in ‚Äòauthorization permission&#8217; errors</a><br />
4) <a href="#not_followed">Increase in not followed pages</a></p>
<p>Main site errors alerts:</p>
<p>5) <a href="#access">Google can&#8217;t access your site</a><br />
6) <a href="#outages">Possible outages</a></p>
<p>Important alerts unrelated to crawl errors:</p>
<p>7) <a href="#high_number">Googlebot found an extremely high number of URLs on your site</a><br />
8) <a href="#traffic_change">Big traffic change for top URL</a></p>
<h2 id="-a-id-not_found-font-color-orange-b-1-increase-in-not-found-errors-b-font-a-"><a id="not_found"><font color="orange"><b>1) Increase in ‚Äònot found&#8217; errors</b></font>  </a></h2>
<p><strong>What Google says:</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8216;Google detected a significant increase in the number of URLs that return a 404 (Page Not Found) error.&#8217;</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="Google Webmaster Tools graph Increase in not found errors" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20140617_051133_GWT-URL-errors-not-found.png"></p>
<p><strong>Google Webmaster Tools provides:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A sample list with priorities according to Google, and the date the error was detected.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How the Botify Logs Analyzer can help:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Check which categories these 404 pages belong to: a type of page that should be crawled? One that shouldn&#8217;t? A non-identified type of url format (possibly a malformed url)?</li>
<li>Check if (or which part of) these 404s are new: a graph specifically shows crawl on urls that were never crawled by Googlebot before.</li>
<li>Check when this surge in 404s started : perhaps it started slowly some time before the alert.</li>
<li>Locate pages where these 404s are linked from (with the website crawler that comes with the Botify Logs Analyzer)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-a-id-soft404-font-color-orange-b-2-increase-in-soft-404-errors-b-font-a-"><a id="soft404"><font color="orange"><b>2) Increase in ‚Äòsoft 404&#8242; errors</b></font>  </a></h2>
<p><strong>What Google says:</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8216;Google detected a significant increase in URLs we think should return a 404 (Page Not Found) error but do not.&#8217;</em></p>
<p><strong>Google Webmaster Tools provides:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A sample list with priorities according to Google and the date each error was detected</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How the Botify Logs Analyzer can help:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Check Googlebot crawl status codes for categories the urls in Google&#8217;s sample list belong to, to see if the problem occurs with all pages from given templates or only some.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-a-id-forbidden-font-color-orange-b-3-increase-in-authorization-permission-errors-b-font-a-"><a id="forbidden"><font color="orange"><b>3) Increase in ‚Äòauthorization permission&#8217; errors</b></font>  </a></h2>
<p><strong>What Google says:</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8216;Google detected a significant increase in the number of URLs we were blocked from crawling due to authorization permission errors.&#8217;</em></p>
<p>In other words, Googlebot is getting a &#8220;Forbidden&#8221; status code (http 403) when requesting some urls.<br />
Either these pages should be crawled by Googlebot (and return http 200 &#8211; OK), or they should not, in which case Googlebot should not waste crawl ressources trying to access these pages: they should be disallowed in the robots.txt file.</p>
<p><strong>Google Webmaster Tools provides:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A sample list with priorities according to Google and the date each error was detected</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How the Botify Logs Analyzer can help:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Check http acodes for corresponding categories (determined from the urls in Google&#8217;s sample list), to see if the problem occurs with all pages from given templates or only some.</li>
<li>Check overall forbidden crawl volume and ratio to assess problem severity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-a-id-not_followed-font-color-orange-b-4-increase-in-not-followed-pages-b-font-a-"><a id="not_followed"><font color="orange"><b>4) Increase in not followed pages</b></font>  </a></h2>
<p><strong>What Google says:</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8216;Google detected a significant increase in the number of URLs that we were unable to completely follow.&#8217;</em></p>
<p>Examples of redirects which won&#8217;t be completed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Redirects to pages not found</li>
<li>Chains of redirects (Google will only follow a limited number of redirects forming a chain)</li>
<li>Loops of redirects (page A redirects to page B, which in turn redirects to page A)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What GWT provides:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A sample list with priorities according to Google and the date each error was detected</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How the Botify Logs Analyzer can help:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Check redirects volume, by type of redirected page</li>
<li>Check redirect targets,through a website crawl (using the crawler that comes with the Logs Analyzer)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-a-id-access-font-color-orange-b-5-google-can-t-access-your-site-b-font-a-"><a id="access"><font color="orange"><b>5) Google can&#8217;t access your site</b></font>  </a></h2>
<p><strong>What Google says:</strong></p>
<p>A variety of messages warning about site-level issues that result in a peak of DNS problems, Server connectivity problems, or problems getting the site&#8217;s robots.txt file.</p>
<p>For example:<br />
<em>&#8216;Over the last 24 hours, Googlebot encountered 89 errors while attempting to connect to your site. Your site&#8217;s overall connection failure rate is 3.5%.&#8217;</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="Google Webmaster Tools Site Errors" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20140617_044213_GWT-site-errors-details.png"></p>
<p><strong><a><font color="red"><b>Beware of robots.txt fetch errors: Google will stop crawling!</b></font>  </a></strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="Google Webmaster Tools site errors" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20140617_051133_GWT-site-errors.png"></p>
<p>For example:<br />
*‚ÄòOver the last 24 hours, Googlebot encountered 531 errors while attempting to access your robots.txt. To ensure that we didn&#8217;t crawl any pages listed in that file, we postponed our crawl. Your site&#8217;s overall robots.txt error rate is 100.0%&#8217; *</p>
<p>Google will announce that its crawl is postponed even if the error rate is not 100%. In most examples we&#8217;ve seen, error rates were above 40%, but we&#8217;ve also seen the same message with a robots.txt fetch error rate below 10%.</p>
<p><strong>What GWT provides:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The type or error (DNS, server connectivity, access to the robots.txt file)</li>
<li>A number of failed attempts and failure rate over the last 24 hours</li>
<li>The ‚Äòfetch as Google&#8217; tool to try to request the robots.txt file as Googlebot would.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course the one to turn to regarding DNS and connectivity issues is your service provider.</p>
<p><strong>How the Botify Logs Analyzer can help:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Check Googlebot&#8217;s crawl on the robots.txt file (Tip: create a category just for the robots.txt url to be able to be able to keep a close eye on it).<br />
You will be able to see http status codes, not only for the last 24 hours, but for the full history: perhaps there were earlier minor episodes of robots.txt unavailability, ones that did not trigger any Google alert?<br />
It could be error http status codes such as http 5XX (server error), or no http response &#8211; which will result in the logs as a lower daily crawl volume on the robots.txt file.<br />
Mapping those dates to the website&#8217;s updates deployment schedule might help narrow down possible causes.</li>
<li>In the case of a connection failures: see if there was a high activity from bots and users, causing heavy server load that may be instrumental in a high connection failure rate.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-a-id-outages-font-color-orange-b-6-possible-outages-b-font-a-"><a id="outages"><font color="orange"><b>6) Possible outages</b></font>  </a></h2>
<p><strong>What Google says:</strong></p>
<p><em>‚ÄòWhile crawling your site, we have noticed an increase in the number of transient soft 404 errors&#8217;</em></p>
<p>This is quite similar to connection failures.</p>
<p><strong>What GWT provides:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The date and time around which Googlebot experienced the increase in transient soft 404 errors  leading to believe there were ‚Äòpossible outages&#8217;.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How the Botify Logs Analyzer can help:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Check Googlebot crawl volume and status codes on the day of the transient soft 404 errors happened.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-a-id-high_nb-font-color-orange-b-7-googlebot-found-an-extremely-high-number-of-urls-on-your-site-b-font-a-"><a id="high_nb"><font color="orange"><b>7) Googlebot found an extremely high number of URLs on your site</b></font>  </a></h2>
<p><strong>What Google says:</strong></p>
<p><em>‚ÄòGooglebot encountered problems while crawling your site [site name].Googlebot encountered extremely large numbers of links on your site. This may indicate a problem with your site&#8217;s URL structure. [&#8230;]&#8217;</em></p>
<p>The message goes on to explain, in essence, that that does not look right: these urls must include duplicates, or pages that were not intended to be crawled by search engines.</p>
<p><strong>GWT provides :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A list of sample urls that may cause the problem. The list may not cover all problems, cautions Google.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How the Botify Logs Analyzer can help:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Check if there was any recent change in Googlebot&#8217;s crawl activity</li>
<li>Check which page categories consume a large amount of crawl, which don&#8217;t generate organic visits</li>
<li>Check if a significant amount of crawl is due to &#8220;warning urls&#8221; (urls that should not be crawled, and are identified as such in the logs analyzer)</li>
<li>Check if there is a large amount of new pages crawled; if so, when this new crawl started, and if the start was abrupt</li>
<li>Check the website structure with the crawler that comes with the Logs Analyzer: very high volumes are often associated to increased depth (see <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/top-5-causes-depth">top reasons for website depth</a>) and duplicates, two problems which often overlap.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-a-id-traffic_change-font-color-orange-b-8-big-traffic-change-for-top-url-b-font-a-"><a id="traffic_change"><font color="orange"><b>8) Big traffic change for top URL</b></font>  </a></h2>
<p><strong>What Google says:</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8216;search results clicks for [this url] have increased/decreased significantly.&#8217;</em></p>
<p><strong>Google Webmaster Tools provides:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The url with increased/decreased traffic.</li>
</ul>
<p>*<em>How the Botify Logs Analyzer can help: *</em></p>
<p>If this was caused by algorithm changes on Google&#8217;s part, chances are there are other significant trends on other pages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the list of pages that generate most organic traffic over a given period: export this data before and after the period where the big traffic change happened. Do this by category as there could be different trends depending on the type of page.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of a significant traffic decrease, the page&#8217;s content should also be checked, as well as the website&#8217;s internal linking (which can be done with the crawler that comes with the Botify Logs Analyzer).</p>
