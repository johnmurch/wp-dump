<p>By drawing information from Google Search Console, our newest innovation Botify Keywords pairs real rankings (not scraped keywords) with 350+ technical SEO KPIs to generate unprecedented insights into the organic search ranking process.</p>
<p>In this post, we break down four specific use cases that can help SEOs increase rankings, fix structural issues, optimize on-page content, increase click-through rate, and bolster organic views.<br />
<img decoding="async" alt="blog-background-green@2x" src="//images.contentful.com/x3pujrb0lw7o/2WIqChpjRm4w4akWEgCiAO/87d4e48b5655ffbc2d6c2ce0a60361b8/blog-background-green_2x.png"></p>
<h3 id="1-generate-a-list-of-top-keywords-that-will-produce-immediate-results">1. Generate a list of top keywords that will produce immediate results</h3>
<p>Botify Keywords allows you to keep track of an unbeatable number of keywords, all generated from real data in GSC. But Botify Keywords also makes it easy to isolate top performing keywords and pages through metrics and reports.</p>
<p>This can expose key findings quickly, and lead to immediate insights and results. For instance, in a few clicks, you can manipulate a mass of pages to understand impressions, clicks, and CTRs, and analyze individual URLs for technical SEO optimization opportunities.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="Keywords Explorer" src="//images.contentful.com/x3pujrb0lw7o/7gCS8tZwwEICqueoqK0O84/43324f06c698185f86ab8939244d0525/kw-solutions-6.png"></p>
<p>Going further than that, Botify Keywords can break down this crucial data by device. You can generate the impressions, clicks, and CTRs on mobile devices for specific keywords and compare them against the overall page numbers for the same categories to understand how keyword metrics are being driven by mobile devices.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="BK 2" src="//images.contentful.com/x3pujrb0lw7o/2rHdHBFIXKwKKKOwq6kEIw/dba85aee6717659e3fedaa74f2f5e3ca/use-case-img-2.png"></p>
<p>This information will give you immediate insight into how mobile customers are using your website. Is mobile CTR much lower than desktop CTR? Are the keywords and volumes of impressions different depending on the situation of the &#8220;searcher&#8221;? These are insights you can gain instantly by adding mobile metrics.</p>
<p>Another quick insight: you can analyze all these metrics with the page type segmentation activated, and extract top keywords from them. The report below shows how ranking and click performance can be different depending on the site&#8217;s segments:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="use-case-img-3" src="//images.contentful.com/x3pujrb0lw7o/2kllDc09YcIiAUagWUGqEM/dca5e3dae95c5b250e2412e6b1a2dbfc/use-case-img-3.png"></p>
<p>As for all the other sections in Botify, every chart gives access to all the details behind the KPIs. By clicking on green section for a page type category, you will create a list of some of the top ranked pages on your website, and the keyword metrics (impressions, clicks, CTR) that are associated with those pages.</p>
<p>Botify can chart how the traffic on these top pages has fluctuated, along with when certain keywords have gained momentum, and other metrics that track actual user queries and traffic over time.</p>
<p>Using this information, you can start adapting your content depending on what people search for, when they search for it, and on what device. This can help you plan keyword strategy for seasonality and new product launches.</p>
<h3 id="2-finding-traffic-opportunities-create-a-list-of-strategic-pages-ranked-position-1-but-with-low-ctrs">2. Finding traffic opportunities: create a list of strategic pages ranked position 1, but with low CTRs</h3>
<p>You can use Botify Keywords to isolate pages that are ranking high for keywords, but suffering from poor CTRs. Then you can examine each URL individually to see if on-page or technical SEO is causing an issue. Are low CTRs caused by poorly optimized content in the meta title or description? Does the page include its highest ranking terms in the on-page content?</p>
<p>To generate this list, you can start with one of the reports in Botify Keywords:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="use-case-img-4" src="//images.contentful.com/x3pujrb0lw7o/1yBRa6E6BeWWgsG2A4skU/538762a8c4f920a143fe00c0debc930e/use-case-img-4.png"></p>
<p>This report gives an overview of pages, ranked in position 1, that are missing the main keyword in on-page markers such as title, h1 tags, and URL. If you click on one of the yellow sections, you&#8217;ll end up with a list of all these top ranked pages, along with the on-page marker that&#8217;s missing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="BK 5" src="//images.contentful.com/x3pujrb0lw7o/26y3zfrbqww4MKAOmaykeC/5ef62159ce45e8180e2370b12a38ba44/use-case-img-5.png"></p>
<p>Now drill down further. Filter by CTR. Only display URLs with CTR &lt; 5%.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="use-case-img-6" src="//images.contentful.com/x3pujrb0lw7o/5Im1u4FUHKKQ0MGQso0QqI/d7f454c964c85bbc5f7c157fcf0573eb/use-case-img-6.png"></p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="BK 7" src="//images.contentful.com/x3pujrb0lw7o/1YkLUcAlRiUqYuekMykKGs/d723bdb355940951f2bf3b51b3c3828f/use-case-img-7.png"></p>
<p>In just three clicks, you&#8217;ve developed a list of top ranking URLs that are prime candidates for on-page optimization. Adding the keyword to the title, h1, and other on-page markers for these pages is an easy win. This could increase click-through rates for pages that are already ranking at the top.</p>
<p>You could also do the opposite, sorting for pages with a high number of impressions and a high CTR, but a low ranking. In other words, a scenario in which people click on your brand when they see it, but miss your page because it&#8217;s too low in the rankings to see.</p>
<h3 id="3-on-page-optimization-using-real-data">3. On-page Optimization, Using Real Data</h3>
<p>Many organizations have employees who are not SEO specialists, but who remain responsible for a wide array of on-page content. They usually deal with basic SEO issues such as keyword deployment, writing title/h1/meta description, and content management. Botify Keywords can enable these employees to make smart on-page decisions, with reports such as these:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="use-case-img-8" src="//images.contentful.com/x3pujrb0lw7o/2NKpcyoghGaWocasYkA4oC/d24b1204a45962ee0857c0db30613c1c/use-case-img-8.png"></p>
<p>This report is an easy way to access pages that are under-optimized due to missing tags. The insights mean your team can quickly find on-page tweaks to boost SEO. These reports match ranking with content quality, and offer value to front-facing content producers who must consider basic SEO principles during production.</p>
<p>For more advanced content analysis, consider these reports:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="use-case-img-9" src="//images.contentful.com/x3pujrb0lw7o/1jbaRtkWmECMqIMkKmCK24/7f13a361ae5d7b4ed14a96afd851bfb1/use-case-img-9.png"></p>
<p>This chart shows how content size affects click performance, in terms of ranking. The pages are sorted by segment. Here we see that content of 1000+ words accounts for a wide majority of the click percentage for the entire site.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="use-case-img-10" src="//images.contentful.com/x3pujrb0lw7o/6tRDXcvAzecwGeMKmwQsgs/1312ee3cd1aeab2d723f96f010caaf1d/use-case-img-10.png"></p>
<p>This chart shows how content size effects ranking and click performance. The chart tells us that almost 100% of the pages ranked in the top 10 are 1000+ words. Click performance is distributed half-and-half between 5000+ and 1000-5000 for the first position, but by the end of the distribution, most ranked content is in the 1000 &#8211; 5000 range.</p>
<p>You can also see the larger amount of traffic that the first three positions generate. This would suggest that content in the 5000+ range is primed to deliver more clicks. Overall, on-page optimization is made easier by these contextualized charts. SEOs and non-specialists alike can use the visualization to hone in on on-page factors.</p>
<h3 id="4-identify-and-correct-structural-problems-that-can-directly-affect-ranking-and-clicks">4. Identify and correct structural problems that can directly affect ranking and clicks</h3>
<p>Botify Keywords integrates Google Search Console insights with over 350 technical SEO KPIs. That means Botify Keywords can illustrate how technical metrics such as page depth, load time, internal linking, <a href="https://www.botify.com/learn/basics/pagerank" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="8" title="page rank" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pagerank</a>, and so on, are affecting rankings and clicks.</p>
<p>Consider these reports, which chart the influence of internal pagerank on ranking:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="use-case-img-11" src="//images.contentful.com/x3pujrb0lw7o/4V2oNWCIVGKOCq8QQucY00/991c198cbb4559ee398a48ba4a2c029b/use-case-img-11.png"></p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="use-case-img-12" src="//images.contentful.com/x3pujrb0lw7o/6dyqFF3bpe2guwAkYgS402/acf9f0bddce9df70a8cabf29ea1adbfe/use-case-img-12.png"></p>
<p>This first distribution shows that pages with an internal pagerank of 10 &#8211; 9 are the most likely to receive top rankings. You can click on the sections of the graph to drill down on specific problem areas, and examine individual URLs for missing inlinks, anchor text, and other pagerank factors.</p>
<p>The second graph is similar, but it shows the percentage of clicks that ranked pages get, as a function of internal pagerank. No surprise here for SEOs, the disparity is even greater. Pages ranked in the top spot account for a much higher click share than any other position.</p>
<p>These reports show the impact of inlinks on ranking:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="use-case-img-13" src="//images.contentful.com/x3pujrb0lw7o/38eeidzWcU0gqeCQgeqk60/7c6def580abe16876d9202502a2ca090/use-case-img-13.png"></p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="use-case-img-14" src="//images.contentful.com/x3pujrb0lw7o/1u7GnPBAMYEAKm0EiMQAUA/5a5b825b3bbbaa1bb10c51f75c0630a1/use-case-img-14.png"></p>
<p>The first report shows that the number of ranked pages increases along with inlinks up until about 1000+ inlinks. But it looks like the distribution of positions within the 1000+ inlinks category is similar to the other four sets. This might suggest that the large amount of inlinks is not responsible for the drop off in rankings. It&#8217;s just less common for a page to have 1000+ inlinks.</p>
<p>The second report shows ranked pages, in terms of number of inlinks, graphed against number of clicks. According to the graph, the higher the link count, the more dominate the top ranked page is in terms of click share.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a report that pairs ranking with load time:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="use-case-img-15" src="//images.contentful.com/x3pujrb0lw7o/R4d6Jj0xMaWEYQEW4OewE/f4253a8c4867ae65b8c8c644d1cfc654/use-case-img-15.png"></p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="use-case-img-16" src="//images.contentful.com/x3pujrb0lw7o/1FYYNo55UA0wisyguK6Ksu/4fe0adb74a9b7d57cff52fd616c45f43/use-case-img-16.png"></p>
<p>Here you can see that most of the site&#8217;s best rankings (green, light green, yellow) also happen to have the fastest load time. They also account for over half the site&#8217;s clicks. Of course, the reports above are just examples, and your own site will look different. Each site has its own unique structural story to tell, and Botify Keywords is ready to tell it.</p>
