<h3 id="optimize-content-for-google-s-new-requirements">Optimize Content for Google&#8217;s New Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Ensure content parity between AMP and canonical content to avoid penalties</strong></p>
<p>Botify is the only <a href="https://www.botify.com/platform" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="1" title="enterprise seo platform">SEO platform</a> that evaluates content like Google. Since February 1st, Google has been officially requiring AMP and canonical pages <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2017/11/engaging-users-through-high-quality-amp.html">to match or to share &#8220;close parity&#8221;</a> with one another, or face penalties. Our new <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/analyze-all-of-google's-content-ranking-signals-in-a-single-dashboard-with-Botify">content quality dashboard</a> enables SEOs to precisely measure content parity between AMP pages and their canonicals to understand how parity impacts the visibility of AMP pages in the SERPs.</p>
<p><strong>Optimize <a href="https://www.botify.com/learn/guides/structured-data-basics-using-schema-org-to-help-search-engines-understand-your-content" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="3" title="structured data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">structured data</a> to slay the future of search</strong></p>
<p>Google&#8217;s latest moves on topics such as <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2017/12/rich-results-tester.html">rich results</a>, <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/voice-search-optimization/231319/">voice search</a>, and <a title="job postings" href="https://www.botify.com/blog/google-jobs-new-guidelines-stay-compliant-and-visible-with-botify">job postings</a> signal that the era of structured data is here! For each page Botify analyzes, structured data are now automatically <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/breaking-news-introducing-botify-structured-data-optimizations">extracted and evaluated</a>. Schema such as Product, Offers, Restaurant, Postal Address, Job Posting, Ratings, Date, Recipe, and Breadcrumb can be combined with technical SEO and Keywords Research KPIs to create a clear picture of how structured data fits into the big SEO picture!</p>
<h3 id="base-keyword-strategy-on-local-insights-with-the-new-version-of-botify-keywords">Base Keyword Strategy on Local Insights with the New Version of Botify Keywords</h3>
<p><strong>Botify Keywords (with geolocation) enhances worldwide market share</strong></p>
<p>The new age of SEO requires SEOs to go beyond scraping. <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/breaking-news-introducing-botify-keywords">Botify Keywords</a> empowers SEOs to base their keywords research and tracking on authentic trending data pulled directly from Google Search Console. This new version of Botify Keywords includes a new section analyzing keywords performance by country. Country is now also a new filter in Keywords Explorer. It&#8217;s time to adapt your strategy based on where people are looking for you!</p>
<h3 id="technical-seo-we-re-raising-the-bar-again">Technical SEO: We&#8217;re Raising the Bar, Again</h3>
<p><strong>Crawl and analyze up to 50 million pages per domain</strong></p>
<p>Analyze up to 50 million pages per crawl! This is double our <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/breaking-news-introducing-25-million-page-crawl">previous record</a>, because we know our customers &#8211; some among the largest companies in the world &#8211; need uber-enterprise level capacity. And the best part: this new capacity still includes all the same analytics and features that make our platform the superior SEO solution including segmentation, filtering, and the entirety of URL Explorer. The only difference is the size. We always match the enterprise needs of SEOs!</p>
<p><strong>Fully map linking architecture with the new Link Selector</strong></p>
<p>Internal linking is a powerful tool but manipulating internal links at scale can be difficult. Our new Link Selector makes it easy to clean and optimize your internal linking. Any linking related KPIs become potential filters for your reports and customized linking exports, such as listing all low quality sources with broken links to a strategic segment. Any other Botify KPIs like anchor text, Google crawl volume on source page, and <a href="https://www.botify.com/learn/basics/pagerank" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="8" title="page rank" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PageRank</a> can be used to complete your export.</p>
<h3 id="make-seos-lives-even-easier-with-superior-customer-experience">Make SEOs&#8217; Lives (Even) Easier with Superior Customer Experience</h3>
<p><strong>Instantaneously compare any KPI with any past analysis</strong></p>
<p>Botify&#8217;s unique crawl comparison capabilities allow SEOs to instantly compare any Botify KPI with any past analysis. Whether the crawl was one week ago, one month ago, or one year ago, our capacities now enable SEOs to instantly compare any data point between two crawls, from the biggest top level reports, to the most granular, specific KPIs. Botify&#8217;s crawl comparison is the most detailed &#8211; and only &#8211; solution that can reveal how every facet of an SEO&#8217;s site has changed at the URL level.</p>
<p><strong>Generate XML Sitemaps in just one click from URL Explorer</strong></p>
<p>Make sitemaps for enterprise websites <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/botify-xml-sitemap-generator-create-sitemap-in-one-click">with the click of a button</a>. Organize sitemaps by site segment or prioritize high-value content in sitemaps. Click on the XML Sitemap Generator and be done. Verify the sitemaps&#8217; success through Botify&#8217;s SEO log file analysis by monitoring as URLs are discovered by search engines.</p>
<p><strong>Save time and make projects move faster with Botify&#8217;s new export capacities</strong></p>
