<p><strong>Botify&#8217;s revenue estimates allow you to see the biggest missed opportunities on your site, in dollars, for all sectors and objectives:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>E-Commerce:</strong> Find a product page that could generate much more revenue if it boosted its mobile visits? Use Botify metrics, such as missed clicks and device CTR, to steer more mobile traffic to that specific page.</li>
<li><strong>Lead Generation:</strong> Uncover a landing page that seems to be producing a low amount of revenue? Consider user behavior factors such as bounce rate, time on the page, and average pages viewed on the pages that link to the landing page. Understand how users are responding to your content and make optimizations that will drive them to convert.</li>
<li><strong>Publishers:</strong> Want to measure the impact of your optimizations on ad revenue? Plug in your ad revenue rate per visit to generate tangible dollar amounts, and then cross-reference them with engagement KPIs such as real CTR and volume of impressions to identify your next opportunities.</li>
</ul>
