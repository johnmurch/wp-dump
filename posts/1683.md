<p>The Botify report answers a virtually unlimited number of questions. Here are 30 you should be asking.<em> Illustrations have been updated to show the current Botify interface.</em></p>
<p>*<em>Virtually unlimited, really? *</em><br />
Yes, that&#8217;s a bold statement. Nevertheless realistic: there are around 50 indicators available for every single page in a Botify website analysis &#8211; built on a dozen pieces of data gathered for each page during the crawl. As a result, the crawl report, combined with the URL Explorer that allows to <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/url-explorer-filter-export">extract and export any data</a>, provides answers to a virtually unlimited number of questions.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s set the scene first. Here is what the left menu looks like in the Botify report:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="pull-right" style="margin: 5px 5px 20px 5px;" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20150504_023031_botify_menu.png" width="180px" /></p>
<p>The different sections cover three sorts of indicators:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indicators related to the way pages can be accessed (that&#8217;s the three first tabs: distribution, performance and HTTP status codes)</li>
<li>Indicators related to page content meta data (HTML tags and canonical)</li>
<li>Indicators related to internal linking (Inlinks for incoming links, Outlinks for outgoing links)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that there will be additional sections if optional analysis settings were used:</p>
<ul>
<li>A visits section if Google Analytics imports were enabled</li>
<li>A sitemaps section if the sitemaps analysis option was enabled</li>
</ul>
<p>And now, let&#8217;s walk through the main report sections and some of the questions they answer.</p>
<h2 id="distribution">Distribution</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20150504_033820_depth.png" alt="Botify report depth distribution graph" /></p>
<p><strong>Distribution of all pages by page depth</strong></p>
<p>Depth is the number of clics needed to reach a page from the home page using the shortest path (actually, from the page the crawl was started from &#8211; that&#8217;s usually the home page).</p>
<ul>
<li>What&#8217;s the average depth of my website ?</li>
<li>What&#8217;s the maximum depth of my website ?</li>
<li>What does the distribution graph look like?</li>
</ul>
<p>Any of these could hint to <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/top-5-causes-depth">depth problems</a>, and result in insufficient crawl by search engine robots.</p>
<p>Note that the depth distribution graph also shows indexable vs non-indexable pages, according to the most basic compliance criteria: read more about<a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/seo-compliant-urls"> indexable URLs</a>.</p>
<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20150504_033820_perf.png" alt="Botify report perfrormance graph" /></p>
<p><strong>Page download time performance</strong></p>
<p>Download perfomance is the delay to get the full page code, without requesting associated ressources such as images etc. This ‚Äòtotal delay&#8217; for the HTML page only is what should be considered for SEO. We recently explained why <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/performance-really-matters-seo">performance matters</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the average page download time on my website?</li>
<li>Are some pages much slower than others?</li>
<li>Can I find out which templates they correspond to?</li>
<li>How much of the total delay does the ‚Äòdelay first byte received&#8217; represent? (that&#8217;s the the time that elapses before the robot starts receiving data). That one is for advanced performance improvements.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="http-status-codes-page-not-found-redirects-etc-">HTTP status codes (page not found, redirects etc.)</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20150504_033820_http_pie.png" alt="Botify report http status codes graph" /></p>
<p><strong>HTTP status code returned when the page is requested</strong></p>
<p>‚ÄòPage not found&#8217; errors, too many redirections‚Ä¶ These are negative signals for search engines trying to assess your website&#8217;s quality. Not to mention that a high redirection rate has a negative impact on their robots&#8217; crawl.<br />
In addition, issues with HTTP 404s are not necessarily visible from a user&#8217;s perspective: a page can return HTTP 404 (Not found) and still return content, and appear as a valid page (like a HTTP 200 &#8211; OK) to the user ! However, search engines won&#8217;t index it‚Ä¶.</p>
<ul>
<li>Which percentage of my pages return a HTTP 200 (OK) status code?</li>
<li>Which percentage of my pages are ‚Äònot found&#8217; (HTTP 404)?</li>
<li>Do some pages respond with HTTP 403 (Forbidden)?</li>
<li>Which percentage of my pages are redirected? Permanent redirections (301) or temporary ones (302)?</li>
<li>Where are they redirected to? Is there a large number of pages redirected to the same page? Are some redirected to pages ‚Äònot found&#8217;?</li>
<li>Are there redirection chains?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="html-tags-related-to-page-content">HTML tags related to page content</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20150504_034014_HTML_tags.png" alt="Botify report content tags" /></p>
<p><strong>H1, Title, meta description tags</strong></p>
<p>The simplest of SEO optimizations, so self-evident and necessary. Why would we neglect simple tags that clarify and emphasize the page content?</p>
<p>For each type of tag, we answer questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many are unique to each page, or common to a number of pages (duplicate)?</li>
<li>Are there pages with several tags of the same kind in the same page? (two H1 for instance)</li>
<li>In which pages is this type of tag missing?</li>
<li>Can I get the list of pages with a tag common to at least 5 other pages? (and the tag content of course!)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="canonicals">Canonicals</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20150504_034110_canonicals.png" alt="Botify report content tags" /></p>
<p><strong> http://www&#8230;&#8221; /&gt; tags</strong></p>
<p>To indicate that the current page is not the primary version of this content, but the page in the <a href="https://www.botify.com/learn/basics/canonical-tags" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="6" title="canonical tags" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canonical tag</a> is.</p>
<p>The indicator has three possible values: ‚Äòdifferent&#8217; when the canonical tag points to another page (that&#8217;s the tag&#8217;s purpose); ‚Äòequal&#8217; means the page points toitself (which has no real benefit, but allows to implement the tag systematically ) and ‚Äònot set&#8217;.</p>
<p>If there are canonical tags pointing to alternate urls, it means there is duplicate or near-duplicate content. That&#8217;s worth looking into it. The other possibility is that canonical tags are implemented wrong. Either way, you will want to know!</p>
<ul>
<li>How many pages have a canonical tag pointing to another page ?</li>
<li>How many pages point to the same canonical page? That&#8217;s the number of duplicates or pseudo-duplicates of the page.</li>
<li>Do some canonical tags point to pages that are redirected (HTTP 3XX) or not found (404)?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="inlinks">Inlinks</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20150504_034636_inlinks.png" alt="Botify report internal linking - inlinks" /></p>
<p><strong>Internal incoming links, from a page&#8217;s perspective</strong></p>
<p>Internal links are ‚Äòvotes&#8217; for your own pages. The website&#8217;s internal linking structure should be in phase with the content hierarchy and create a sort of relief map that puts important content forward. Inlinks provide a view from the vote&#8217;s recipients perspective.</p>
<ul>
<li>Which pages receive the highest number of internal links? Or more precisely the highest number of ‚Äòfollow&#8217; links?</li>
<li>Which pages receive the highest number of links and do not return HTTP 200 (OK)?</li>
<li>Which pages receive only one link?</li>
<li>Which pages receive the highest number ‚Äòno follow&#8217; links?</li>
<li>Which pages have a ‚Äòno follow&#8217; directive both in links and in a meta tag?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="outlinks">Outlinks</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/20150504_034636_outlinks.png" alt="Botify report internal linking - outlinks" /></p>
<p>** Links coming out of a page &#8211; and going either inside the site (internal outlinks), or outside (external outlinks)**</p>
<p>As a complement to inlinks information, outlinks indicators show where internal ‚Äòvotes&#8217; go. Are some votes wasted on content that doesn&#8217;t deserve them ?</p>
<ul>
<li>Which pages contain the highest number of links?</li>
<li>Which pages include broken links (links to pages ‚Äònot found&#8217; &#8211; HTTP 404)?</li>
<li>Which pages link to redirected pages (HTTP 3XX)?</li>
<li>Which pages send the highest amount of &#8220;link juice&#8221; outside of my website?</li>
<li>Which pages contain no follow links? To internal pages, or to external pages?</li>
</ul>
<p>In all these metrics, the number of links in a page are links to distinct urls (what matters most), but the total number of links that takes into account multiple links to the same page is also available.</p>
<p>This post covers <em>some</em> of the most usual questions. Let us know if there are scenarios you would like to explore. Leave a comment! We&#8217;ll do our best to indulge.</p>
