<p>How much potential for organic traffic is lurking in under-optimized pages?</p>
<p>Chances are, your site has valuable content not generating the organic traffic that it could. Discover how much of your site could be optimized &#8211; and how much additional SEO traffic you could be driving with a simple growth potential calculation.</p>
<p>Detecting your SEO &#8220;growth potential&#8221; is the process of calculating how much additional organic traffic you can potentially generate by identifying and improving under-optimized pages in your site structure.<br />
<img decoding="async" alt="SEO Growth Potential" src="//images.contentful.com/x3pujrb0lw7o/6wXX3VOvviukiWqAWm4IKE/811b7a64f8b7e1e520f32c569cc5264a/growth_potential_blog.png"></p>
<h3 id="what-is-growth-potential-detection">What is Growth Potential Detection</h3>
<p>In an ideal world, your site&#8217;s most strategic pages &#8211; those valuable for SEO purposes &#8211; would achieve 100% <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/top-5-technical-seo-kpis">active pages ratio</a> over the course of a month. That is, 100% would receive SEO visits in that time period. In reality, however, this is rarely true, and it is this portion of inactive pages (those that <em>don&#8217;t</em> receive SEO visits) that holds the most potential for boosting SEO traffic with a little optimization to get them active.</p>
<p>Though nothing is guaranteed, and your calculation won&#8217;t take into account seasonality in search or query popularity, growth potential detection is a valuable tool to prioritize implementations and communicate possible gains with strategic SEO changes when reporting internally or delivering recommendations to a client.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-calculate-your-seo-growth-potential">How to Calculate Your SEO Growth Potential</h3>
<p>The best way to find hidden opportunities for organic traffic is to calculate the potential of your inactive pages to <em>become</em> active and generate SEO visits.</p>
<p>Put simply, the calculation requires three clear steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify segments of pages that can generate more organic traffic</li>
<li>Detect poorly-optimized, inactive pages in those segments</li>
<li>Determine how much traffic these pages could generate if they were well optimized</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1-which-areas-of-your-site-could-be-hiding-potential-">1. Which areas of your site could be hiding potential?</h4>
<p>Choose a segment of your site to focus on first where you suspect there may be unrealized potential. This may be  a section of your site that earns a large portion of your total traffic, or represents a large proportion of your site. Assess each segment in turn to discover the areas of your site most likely to be hiding some under-optimized pages that could give your traffic a boost if SEO was improved.</p>
<p><center><img decoding="async" src="https://gm01botify.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Growth_Potential_Detection_segments.png" width="70%"></center></p>
<h4 id="2-which-pages-in-those-segments-are-not-receiving-organic-traffic-">2. Which pages in those segments are not receiving organic traffic?</h4>
<p>Within your selected segment(s), break down your analysis into active and inactive pages. Determine which inactive pages &#8211; those that did not receive any SEO visits in the last 30 days &#8211; have the potential to be improved in order to generate organic traffic.<br />
<img decoding="async" alt="Growth Potential Detection active pages" src="//images.contentful.com/x3pujrb0lw7o/50zYfk3JEsk4ykmw4602Am/3dd91b3c5b8bb2716ebe89c13260e58b/Growth_Potential_Detection_active_pages.PNG"></p>
<p>In this example, inactive &#8220;articles&#8221; pages that are unique (no duplicate content) and have a significant amount of text (not thin content), represent a large number of URLs that could begin receiving Google traffic.</p>
<p>Identify poorly-optimized pages based on key SEO metrics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Depth &gt; 5</li>
<li>Load Times &gt; 2000 ms</li>
<li>Duplicate content or HTML tags</li>
<li>Not enough inlinks (compared to active pages)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-how-much-traffic-should-these-pages-be-generating-">3. How much traffic should these pages be generating?</h4>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve found the number of pages you plan to optimize, it takes a simple calculation to see just how much organic traffic you could be driving, potentially.</p>
<p>Take the number of inactive pages (IP) with potential, multiplied by the current number of visits received, on average, by each active page.  ‚Üí <strong>IP x visits</strong> = the number of SEO visits you could possibly receive once inactive pages are optimized.</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>growth potential</strong> = the number of inactive pages with potential x potential SEO visits, on average per page.</p>
<p>Simple, right?</p>
<p>For a more accurate idea of your opportunity, perform this calculation at the <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/segmentation">segment</a> level to analyze the potential in specific sections of your site. Identify under-optimized pages then match that with average traffic received by each page in that segment.</p>

<p>Capturing growth potential is a great strategy for prioritizing SEO implementations and beginning to quantify SEO efforts. Expected growth potential can uncover which projects will be most impactful and can guide your roadmap.</p>
