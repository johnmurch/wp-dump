<p>We are happy to announce that Botify has been recognized by Fortune as a <a href="https://www.greatplacetowork.com/best-workplaces/new-york/2022?category=small-and-medium" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Workplace in New York™</a> for the first time. This esteemed award is based entirely on what current employees say about their experience working at Botify. This year, 94% of employees said it’s a great place to work—35 points higher than the average U.S. company!&nbsp;</p>

For our employees, that means caring about their professional and personal development, creating a culture that is centered around growth opportunities, and ensuring a dynamic and exciting environment where individuals can be themselves and make a big impact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Creating a workplace that employees refer to as a &#8220;<a href="https://www.greatplacetowork.com/best-workplaces/new-york/2022?category=small-and-medium" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best place to work</a>&#8221; isn&#8217;t something that can be achieved overnight. This award is a testament to the work done by Botify’s amazing team of employees, whose continuous hard work, resilience and flair for innovation have come to the fore over the last few years.  </p>
