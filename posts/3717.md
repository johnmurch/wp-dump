<p>Botify is proud to announce our <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/commerce-cloud/partner-marketplace/partners/botify/">partnership with Salesforce Commerce Cloud</a>!</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.botify.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/salesforce_commerce_cloud_partnership.png" alt="Botify Salesforce Partners Since 2020" class="wp-image-4925" width="768" height="440" srcset="https://www.botify.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/salesforce_commerce_cloud_partnership.png 1024w, https://www.botify.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/salesforce_commerce_cloud_partnership-300x172.png 300w, https://www.botify.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/salesforce_commerce_cloud_partnership-768x440.png 768w, https://www.botify.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/salesforce_commerce_cloud_partnership-600x344.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure></div>



<p>Commerce Cloud enables the fastest path to unified commerce and helps brands create intelligent, seamless, and personalized digital experiences for shoppers that span web, mobile, social, and in-store.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But attracting consumers to your website is the first step in creating that opportunity to delight and convert them through those optimized experiences. Through this partnership, Salesforce Commerce Cloud customers can now experience the full value of Botify’s <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/seo-data-unification">unified data</a> suite to drive greater performance from the organic search channel, earning more relevant site visitors to convert into buyers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That unified suite includes five key datasets every e-commerce SEO team needs to succeed in organic search.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-types-of-seo-data-your-e-commerce-team-needs">5 types of SEO data your e-commerce team needs</h2>



<p>Organic search is one of the primary drivers of traffic and revenue for Commerce Cloud websites (for reference, <a href="https://weareuv.com/top-10-clothing-brands-that-use-salesforce-commerce-cloud/">clothing brands</a> like UNIQLO and Ralph Lauren are on Commerce Cloud, as well as <a href="https://weareuv.com/top-10-sports-brands-that-use-salesforce-commerce-cloud/">sportswear brands</a> like Adidas and Under Armour).&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/commerce-cloud/resources/seo-tools-for-commerce-cloud-digital/">according to Salesforce</a>, “An analysis of Commerce Cloud customer sites revealed that the majority of site traffic, sales, and conversions come via organic search. In fact, nearly 40% of online shoppers begin their product search with a search engine.”</p>



<p>In order to harness the full potential of that channel, e-commerce teams need to leverage five key types of SEO data.</p>



<h2>1. Crawl data</h2>



<p>In order for e-commerce teams to have full visibility into their websites, they need to be able to crawl every URL, HTML <em>and </em>JavaScript (e.g. reviews or related product widgets, whether native to SFCC or third-party), to collect a full inventory of pages and assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Botify’s <a href="https://www.botify.com/platform/botify-analytics/sitecrawler">SiteCrawler</a> can crawl multiple millions of URLs per crawl at a rate of 250 URLs crawled per second and 100 URLs rendered per second and gives you 1,000+ data points back. The cloud-based crawler runs regular crawls and keeps track of that data over time.</p>



<p>In other words, there’s nothing you won’t know about your site.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-log-file-data">2. Log file data</h2>



<p>Log file data is key to understanding which of your pages search engines are finding vs. missing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/BotifySEO/how-does-google-crawl-the-web-botify-at-smx-paris-2018">According to Botify’s data</a> from 6 billion Googlebot requests, we found that <strong>Google is missing about half of the pages on large enterprise sites</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is critical, since uncrawled pages won’t be indexed, which means they can’t rank or earn traffic and revenue for the business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Botify’s <a href="https://www.botify.com/platform/botify-analytics/loganalyzer">LogAnalyzer</a>, e-commerce SEO teams can easily see which of the pages in their site structure are being missed — and our integration ensures Commerce Cloud SEO teams can easily bring this data into Botify.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.botify.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pasted-image-0-2-1-1024x587.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4632" width="768" height="440" srcset="https://www.botify.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pasted-image-0-2-1-1024x587.png 1024w, https://www.botify.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pasted-image-0-2-1-300x172.png 300w, https://www.botify.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pasted-image-0-2-1-768x440.png 768w, https://www.botify.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pasted-image-0-2-1-600x344.png 600w, https://www.botify.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pasted-image-0-2-1.png 1040w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-keyword-data">3. Keyword data</h2>



<p>Keyword data is one of the most familiar data points in SEO, however, most keyword ranking tools only show you the position you rank for specific keywords you select to track.</p>



<p>This can leave e-commerce SEO teams with a lot of blind spots.</p>



<p>Ideally, you’ll want visibility into:</p>



<ul><li>All the keywords you’re getting impressions for</li><li>How those keywords are trending with your audience over time</li><li>The average position you’re ranking in for each keyword</li><li>The number of clicks (traffic) you’re getting from each keyword and your CTR</li><li>How that data differs by categories like device and location</li></ul>



<p>Botify’s <a href="https://www.botify.com/platform/botify-analytics/realkeywords">RealKeywords</a>, which is powered by the Google Search Console API, not only shows you all this, but because it’s part of a unified data suite, you can also correlate your keyword rankings with crawl and log file data, showing you the true “why” behind your rank performance.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-organic-traffic-data">4. Organic traffic data</h2>



<p>Are your technical and content improvements resulting in more traffic from the organic search channel?&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s contributing to your increase or decrease in organic search traffic?</p>



<p>E-commerce SEO teams can only answer these questions if they’re able to view traffic data alongside their other metrics like crawl data, log data, and rankings data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By integrating with your own Google or Adobe Analytics, Botify allows you to see <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/what-your-website-analytics-isnt-telling-you">what your analytics data isn’t telling you</a> on its own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pro tip! You can also use your traffic data to better understand which pages you should block search engines from crawling. </p>



<p>According to Octiv Digital in their article <a href="https://www.octivdigital.com/ideas-and-advice/8-tips-for-salesforce-commerce-cloud-seo/">8 Tips for Salesforce Commerce Cloud SEO</a>, “Using your analytics system or a tool like Botify, filter for pages that receive zero impressions and clicks from organic search. Block these pages from being crawled to help Google spend more time on the URLs with impressions and click data. Over time, you’ll see an uptick in organic search as Google is better enabled to discover the resources you want crawled.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-engagement-data">5. Engagement data</h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/content/dam/web/en_us/www/documents/commerce-cloud/tei-of-salesforce-commerce-cloud.pdf">Total Economic Impact study of Salesforce Commerce Cloud</a> conducted by Forrester Consulting, organizations get an estimated 35% increase in revenue within three years of switching to Salesforce Commerce Cloud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s critical for e-commerce SEO teams to keep track of these types of revenue increases, especially from the organic search channel, since purchases are the downstream effect of their efforts!</p>



<p>Botify’s <a href="https://www.botify.com/platform/botify-analytics/engagementanalytics">EngagementAnalytics</a> allows you to do just that, powered by your own Google or Adobe Analytics data, in addition to monitoring the other ways searchers are engaging with your site (e.g. Are they bouncing? How many pages are they viewing?).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-most-complete-picture-of-your-commerce-cloud-site-s-performance-in-organic-search">The most complete picture of your Commerce Cloud site’s performance in organic search</h2>

<p>Developing and maintaining a high-performing digital storefront is core to any e-commerce team’s strategy, but ensuring it’s always optimized for search engines and shoppers alike can be an overwhelming task.&nbsp;</p>
