<p>Our mission at Botify is to give SEO stakeholders the data, tools, and diagnostics necessary to create and maintain high quality digital assets for search engines, impacting every stage of the organic search process.</p>
<p>SEOs need a solution that can analyze all the changes on their websites &#8211; wanted or not &#8211; that impact their SEO performance across all time periods. A static snapshot is just not enough! SEOs need to know the data of their websites and URLs exactly as they were in the past to make meaningful comparisons.</p>
<p>Botify&#8217;s new comparison feature does just that! It allows SEOs to navigate and compare their entire archive of SEO projects. SEOs can instantly analyze the changes therein for any SEO KPI or URL and even retrieve the HTML code when it was crawled. Discover how it works!<br />

<p>Botify&#8217;s new comparison capabilities allow SEOs to instantly compare any Botify KPI with that of a past analysis. Whether the change was enacted one week ago, one month ago, or one year ago, our comparison feature dynamically renders instant analysis of the changes between any two Botify crawls or KPIs of your choice.<br />

Botify&#8217;s crawl comparison is the most detailed &#8211; and only &#8211; solution that can reveal how any facet of a website has changed for the better&#8230; or for the worse.</p>
<p>Our customers will create their own use cases. But some important uses of this new feature at both the URL and site segment level include the ability to:</p>
