<p>Today, my co-founders Stan Chauvin, Thomas Grange, and I are thrilled to announce another major milestone in Botify’s journey. We have recently <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/botify-raises-55-million-in-series-c-funding-to-help-brands-unlock-revenue-growth-through-organic-search-301367911.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">raised $55 million in a Series C funding round</a>!</p>



<p>Since our last round, we’ve not only helped our customers, across e-commerce, publishing, travel, and more, drive hundreds of millions of visits and billions of dollars from organic search, but we’ve also tripled our revenue and our valuation! We’d like to thank the nearly 200 amazing Botifyers around the world, spanning New York City to Singapore, as this achievement would not have been possible without them. We’re grateful for the dedication and hard work that every single person has contributed &#8211; especially during an extra challenging 18 months. We consider ourselves extremely lucky to have the opportunity to work with so many amazing talents and it’s incredibly rewarding to see the product innovation, business growth, the diverse culture, and the amazing roster of customers we have all cultivated together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And speaking of our customers, it’s an honor that hundreds of remarkable companies, including Expedia, L’Oréal, The New York Times, Groupon, Marriott, Conde Nast, Crate &amp; Barrel, Fnac Darty, Vestiaire Collective, and Farfetch, have trusted us, supported us, and provided us invaluable feedback along the way. We thank them for their influence in shaping our company, the product we offer today, and what we are working hard to deliver to you in the near future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And finally, we are so appreciative of Eurazeo and Ventech for their continued support of and reinvestment in Botify and are excited to welcome InfraVia Growth and Bpifrance Large Venture to the Botify family.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-what-does-this-funding-mean-for-the-organic-search-market-and-more-importantly-for-our-customers"><strong>So what does this funding mean for the organic search market and &#8211; more importantly- for our customers?</strong></h2>



<p>First and foremost, if 2020 proved anything, it’s that search is an essential part of our lives.&nbsp; As consumers, we turn to search for anything and everything under the sun. For enterprises, this means that being found in search is a bigger opportunity than ever to generate brand awareness and online revenue. It’s no surprise that even in 2020, during a global pandemic, businesses <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-covid-19-has-pushed-companies-over-the-technology-tipping-point-and-transformed-business-forever" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accelerated their digital transformations</a> and <a href="https://financesonline.com/seo-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spent nearly $47.5 billion on SEO!</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shaping the Future of Organic Search Marketing with Automation</strong></h2>



<p>A few months ago, we unveiled the Botify Activation suite, an innovative solution that maximizes search marketers’ and developers’ productivity, resources, and budgets to drive incremental revenue. Its rapid adoption validated the demand and need for greater SEO efficiency and automation, especially as the web becomes more and more complex.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our team is actively developing new capabilities and I am especially excited by our Botify Activation roadmap that represents the future of search.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Machine Learning and AI-Powered Data &amp; Insights&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Botify is known for the unmatched depth and scale of its analytics suite, however analyzing large, complex sets of data can often be time-consuming. SEO data influences all aspects of a digital marketing and website strategy, so gleaning the most impactful optimization opportunities, and doing so quickly and easily, has cascading benefits. With the launch of <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/botify-intelligence-activation-seo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Botify Intelligence</a> in 2020, Botify leveraged data science to automatically surface new opportunities and critical issues, helping brands prioritize website improvements that lead to revenue, while also protecting hard-earned traffic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this additional funding, we are doubling-down on machine learning to develop new, innovative features to speed the development of action plans. By modeling the business impact of any change&nbsp; and arming brands with the tools to automatically implement changes, they will not only maximize their time and resources, but also drive more traffic and revenue from organic search.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Going [even more] Global</strong></h2>



<p>After getting our start in Europe, I moved to New York City in 2016 to open up our first office in the U.S., followed by Seattle a couple of years later. Fast forward to today and the U.S. now accounts for more than 60% of our revenue. Building upon this success, we are establishing and growing operations in Asia Pacific and have already started collaborating with key brands and partners in the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interested in joining us? We’re actively hiring in Singapore, Sydney, and Tokyo, as well London, Paris, NYC, and Seattle. Check out our <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/botify" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open positions</a> here!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Expanding Our Ecosystem</strong></h2>



<p>Another core pillar of Botify’s strategy lies within our ecosystem development, ensuring that we create alignment, interoperability, and collaboration opportunities with the technology and services partners that are essential to our customers’ strategies. Our goal is to simplify their lives &#8211; whether that’s through streamlined data integrations or trainings for their agency partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the past year, Botify forged strategic relationships with <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/salesforce-commerce-cloud-seo-partner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Salesforce Commerce Cloud</a>, <a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/partners/detail/?id=botify&amp;hl=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Cloud,</a> <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/wordpress-vip-seo-partner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WordPress VIP,</a> <a href="https://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/january-2020/bing-partners-with-the-ecosystem-to-drive-fresh-signals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Bing,</a> and <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/partner-insights-2021-holiday-shopping-season-top-tips-from-jellyfish" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jellyfish</a>, to name a few, but we’ve just scratched the surface. We are committed to expanding our ecosystem of technology, marketing, and solution partners, driving beneficial growth opportunities for all parties involved, creating platform flexibility, and extending the value of Botify to additional audiences. In fact, by the end of 2021, we will have quintupled our partnerships team!&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’d like to explore a partnership with us, please reach out to us! <a href="https://www.botify.com/partners" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">We’d love to hear from you.</a></p>



<p>Following a rollercoaster year, we’ll certainly take a moment to reflect on this achievement and pop some champagne &#8211; but there is more work to be done! We look forward to more success with our wonderful customers and partners and to shaping the future of search together.</p>
