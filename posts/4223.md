<p>Last year, we launched <a href="https://www.botify.com/platform/botify-intelligence/alertpanel">AlertPanel</a>, an early warning system designed to detect SEO issues on your website before they turn into larger, more expensive problems. Since then, we’ve added <a href="https://www.botify.com/blog/new-in-alertpanel-more-alerts-management-features">powerful new alerts</a> to detect various issues, such as incorrect <a href="https://www.botify.com/learn/guides/hreflang-seo-what-you-need-to-know-for-language-optimization" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="2" title="hreflang seo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hreflang</a> values or broken redirects.</p>



<p>In this release, we’re excited to announce that <strong>you</strong> get to decide which alerts get created by building custom alerts directly in Botify. This means you can create an alert to protect your website from unexpected site and search performance issues from metrics such as an increase in URLs above a specified HTML load time, a decrease in the number of ranking pages for a specific category, or a change in URLs above or below a specified page depth.</p>



<p>You can create relevant alerts that matter to you most from any metric currently found in the SiteCrawler URL Explorer.</p>

<p>Imagine you’re an eCommerce website manager. Your company just launched a new, highly sought-after product line on your website that is projected to drive a ton of traffic and revenue just before a Q3 earnings call. Company executives are betting this new product line will allow them to hit their revenue target as website sales are the primary driver of revenue. The website <em>has </em>to work, and the pages must be visible on Google.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To ensure Google is crawling and indexing these pages, create a custom alert to monitor if non-indexable pages increase for this new section of your website. If this increase happens, you will immediately be notified of the issue with an email and Slack alert to resolve the issue before it gets worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>AlertPanel doesn’t just stop at monitoring SEO issues- it detects problems on your website that could impact another department as well. In the example of the new product line pages, the merchandise team wants additional reassurance that the product inventory doesn’t drop below a certain level. To ensure nothing falls through the cracks, you can create a custom alert to notify critical stakeholders every time AlertPanel detects a rise in pages with inventory below a specified level. This way the merchandise team can proactively restock the page’s inventory, redirect the page to an equivalent experience, deprecate the page, or keep the page as is.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is just one of the many alerts you can create with AlertPanel. With custom alerts, you can create alerts based on any metric in Botify SiteCrawler, including:</p>



<ul><li>Segments</li><li>HTML extracts</li><li><a href="https://www.botify.com/learn/guides/structured-data-basics-using-schema-org-to-help-search-engines-understand-your-content" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="3" title="structured data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Structured data</a> &amp; breadcrumbs</li><li>Logs</li><li>Revenue and Conversion data</li><li>Core Web Vitals (Coming Soon)</li></ul>
