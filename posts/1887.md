<p>The <a href="https://www.eugdpr.org/">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> is a significant data privacy regulation that takes effect May 25th, 2018 in all EU nation states and for any company managing the data of EU residents.</p>
<p>But not to worry: Botify is 100% compliant with the GDPR <em>by design</em>.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-gdpr-">What Is the GDPR?</h3>
<p>The GDPR regulates operations performed on personal data &#8211; any information relating to an identifiable natural person &#8211; such as storage, alteration, retrieval, or erasure, among others.</p>
<p>Botify meets all of these by design, and even takes extra steps to ensure the security and privacy of our customers&#8217; data.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-botify-comply-with-the-gdpr-">How Does Botify Comply With the GDPR?</h3>
<p><strong>The Botify platform, and its associated analytics, never request, process, or store personal information, ever. Period. End of story.</strong></p>
<p>Our three industry-leading solutions are all designed to avoid personal data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Botify Analytics</strong> &#8211; Botify crawls websites and harnesses analytics platforms, but does not request any personal data.</li>
<li><strong>Botify Keywords</strong> &#8211; Botify draws information from Google Search Console, but does not request any personal data.</li>
<li><strong>Botify Log Analyzer</strong> &#8211; Botify processes your log files, but does not request any personal data.<br />
#<br />
Botify never processes personal data. Botify may encounter personal IP addresses in server log files, but we recommend customers remove this data before sending it to Botify.</li>
</ul>
<p>Customers can use some of the Botify custom scripts to eliminate personal IP addresses before sending server log files to Botify. <a href="https://ww2.botify.com/contact">Contact your CSM </a>to find out how to easily accomplish this!</p>
<p>If, for some reason, Botify does encounter personalized IP addresses, we permanently remove all of this information before processing your log files.</p>
<p>Botify Log Analyzer has a predefined process to ensure that this personal information is removed:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-2750 size-full" src="https://www.botify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/botify-gdpr.png" alt="botify gdpr" width="1200" height="500" srcset="https://www.botify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/botify-gdpr.png 1200w, https://www.botify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/botify-gdpr-300x125.png 300w, https://www.botify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/botify-gdpr-1024x427.png 1024w, https://www.botify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/botify-gdpr-768x320.png 768w, https://www.botify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/botify-gdpr-600x250.png 600w, https://www.botify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/botify-gdpr-1040x433.png 1040w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>As the flowchart above illustrates, when Botify encounters a log line with an IP address that is not associated with a search engine, it instantly removes the IP address from all processing functions within Botify.</p>
<h3 id="botify-the-highest-standard-in-data-privacy-security">Botify: The Highest Standard in Data Privacy &amp; Security</h3>
<p>Our commitment to data privacy goes beyond the latest regulations. Privacy and security have been fundamental features of our platform since its inception.</p>
<p>The same rules are applied for all customers globally &#8211; not just for the EU-based. Not only is Botify compliant by design, we&#8217;re continually raising the bar to match the very highest standard of data privacy and security for our customers.</p>
