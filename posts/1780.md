<p>Is your site one of the first to be moved to the mobile-first index??</p>
<p>Since May 2015, <a title="when mobile searches surpassed desktop searches" href="https://searchengineland.com/its-official-google-says-more-searches-now-on-mobile-than-on-desktop-220369">when mobile searches surpassed desktop searches</a> on Google, the need for more relevant mobile search results became abundantly clear.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s industry-shaking response to the mobile movement is the impending <a title="mobile-first index" href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/11/mobile-first-indexing.html">mobile-first index</a>.</p>
<p><a title="According to Google's John Mueller" href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-log-files-mobile-first-indexing-24926.html">According to Google&#8217;s John Mueller</a>, a handful of sites are already being tested in the mobile-first index and there&#8217;s now a method for understanding if your site has moved: SEO log file analysis!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="//images.contentful.com/x3pujrb0lw7o/33EWsCdw24KwYOwuIicgEa/11327214461fa685913832f0bd15f5c8/Google_Search_Console_SEO_Botify.png" alt="Google Search Console SEO Botify" /></p>
<h2 id="google-s-mobile-first-index-has-arrived-">Google&#8217;s Mobile-First Index Has Arrived!</h2>
<p>Mobile searches surpassed desktop searches two years ago and the growth in mobile search is still on the rise! Botify&#8217;s recent white paper, <a title="Mobile Roars, SEO Visits Double: Black Friday 2017 Analysis" href="https://go.pardot.com/l/229872/2017-11-27/trlg">Mobile Roars, SEO Visits Double: Black Friday 2017 Analysis</a> found average mobile traffic to be 56% during Black Friday this year.</p>
<p>The mobile-first index is a major shift in the way the Google discovers, evaluates, and prioritizes content (aka, the way Google crawls, indexes, and ranks content).</p>
<p>Historically, Google has used the <a title="desktop version" href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/11/mobile-first-indexing.html">desktop version</a> of a page&#8217;s content to evaluate content relevance. Desktop content isn&#8217;t necessarily relevant for mobile search so relying on desktop content for all search results can create a poor experience for mobile users. To remedy this disconnect, Google got to work creating its <a title="mobile-first index" href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/11/mobile-first-indexing.html">mobile-first index</a> which will use the mobile version of a site&#8217;s content to decide rank.</p>
<p>Google announced the mobile-first index in 2016 but, despite palpable anticipation in the SEO industry, did not share a timeline for its release. Yesterday, <a title="John Mueller" href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-log-files-mobile-first-indexing-24926.html">John Mueller</a> discussed on a Hangout that Google has starting testing a handful of sites within its mobile-first index and revealed how SEOs can identify when they&#8217;ve made the transition!</p>
<h2 id="has-your-site-moved-to-google-s-mobile-first-index-the-answer-is-in-your-log-files">Has Your Site Moved to Google&#8217;s Mobile-First Index? The Answer is in your Log Files</h2>
<p>A few sites have made the move to Google&#8217;s mobile-first index and the rest of the web is close behind. How do you know when your site has transitioned?</p>
<p>In yesterday&#8217;s Hangout, John Mueller offers advice to SEOs:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you watch out for your <strong>log files</strong> probably you can notice [your site&#8217;s transition to the mobile-first index] fairly obviously.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>John explains that on an average site about 80% of the crawl is from Googlebot-desktop and approximately 20% is expected from Googlebot-smartphone.</p>
<p>Once your site has been transitioned to the mobile-first index, you will see that majority reverse. Googlebot-smartphone will be crawling your site more than Googlebot-desktop as in the example below.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="//images.contentful.com/x3pujrb0lw7o/1tcaBcpCpmE0g0KSOYIaq/ed5713866fdfd8a50a8822f660500cee/Screen_Shot_2017-12-15_at_8.55.31_PM.png" alt="Log File Analysis - Mobile-first index" /></p>
<p>Your log files give you a complete, accurate picture of exactly how search engines are crawling your site. Raw log files are dense and difficult to interpret, especially for large sites. Use an SEO log file analyzer like Botify Log Analyzer to get a clear picture of how Google is crawling your entire your site.</p>
<p>Analysis of your complete log files will capture the shift in the way your site is crawled. The key is to look for <em>changes</em> in your crawl as in the example below. Take notice of dramatic increases in the percentage of Googlebot-smartphone crawl to identify when you&#8217;ve been moved to Google&#8217;s mobile-first index.</p>
